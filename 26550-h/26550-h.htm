<p style='line-height: 1'>&nbsp;</p>

<p>They were married in the little Episcopal
church in Eagle Pass on a September day in
the late eighties. The fact may be verified,
I have no doubt, by any who will take the
trouble to examine the records, for the toy-like
place of worship still stands.</p>
<p>The church structure is not, perhaps, so
small as my imagination presents it to me;
but I cannot see it save with the desert as
a background&mdash;the desert austere and illimitable.
You reach the prim little front door
by climbing a street which runs parallel with
the Rio Grande, and the church is almost the
last structure you will pass before you set
forth into a No-Man&#8217;s land of sage and cactus
and yucca and mesquite lying under the blazing
sun.</p>
<p>Harboro his name was. Of course, there
was a Christian name, but he was known simply
as Harboro from Piedras Negras to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
City. She was Sylvia Little. Sylvia, people
called her, both before and after her marriage.
The Little might as well never have belonged
to her.</p>
<p>Although neither Harboro nor Sylvia really
belonged to Eagle Pass, the wedding was an
event. Both had become familiar figures in
the life of the town and were pretty well
known. Their wedding drew a large and interested
audience. (I think the theatrical
phrase is justified, as perhaps will be seen.)
Weddings were not common in the little border
town, unless you counted the mating of
young Mexicans, who were always made one
by the priest in the <i>adobe</i> church closer to
the river. Entertainment of any kind was
scarce. But there were other and more significant
reasons why people wanted to see
the bride and the bridegroom, when Harboro
gave his name to the woman of his choice.</p>
<p>The young people belonging to some sort
of church guild had decorated the church,
and special music had been prepared. And
indeed when Harboro and Sylvia marched
up the aisle to the strains of the <i>Lohengrin</i>
march (the bridegroom characteristically trying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
to keep step, and Sylvia ignoring the music
entirely), it was not much to be wondered at
that people craned their necks to get the
best possible view. For both Harboro and
the woman were in a way extraordinary individuals.</p>
<p>Harboro was forty, and seemed in certain
aspects older than that. He was a big man,
well built, and handsome after a fashion. He
was swarthy, with dark eyes which seemed
to meditate, if not to dream. His hair was
raven-black, and he wore a heavy mustache
which stopped just short of being unduly conspicuous.
It was said of him that he talked
little, but that he listened keenly. By trade
he was a railroad man.</p>
<p>He had been heard to remark on one occasion
that he had begun as a brakeman, but
there were rumors of adventurous days before
he became a member of a train crew.
It was said that he had gone prospecting into
Mexico as a youth, and that he had spent
years working at ends and odds of jobs about
mines and smelters. Probably he had hoped
to get into something in a big way.</p>
<p>However, he had finally turned to railroading,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
and in the course of uncertain events had
become an engineer. It was a year or two
after he had attained this position that he
had been required to haul a special train from
Torreon to Piedras Negras. The General
Manager of the Mexican International Railroad
was on that train, and he took occasion
to talk to the engineer. The result pleased
him mightily. In his engine clothes Harboro
looked every inch a man. There was something
clean and level about his personality
which couldn&#8217;t have been hid under a <i>sarape</i>.
He stood shoulder to shoulder with the General
Manager, making the latter look like a
manikin, and talked about his work and the
condition of the road and the rolling stock.
He talked easily and listened intelligently.
He was grave in an easy fashion. He took
no liberties, cracked no jokes.</p>
<p>The General Manager got the idea that the
big fellow would be a good man to stand
shoulder to shoulder with in larger events
than a special trip.</p>
<p>When he got back to headquarters he made
a casual inquiry or two, and discovered that
Harboro wrote an exceptionally good hand,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
and that he spelled correctly. He assumed
that he was an educated man&mdash;though this
impression may have been largely due to the
fact that Harboro was keenly interested in
a great variety of things, and had a good
memory.</p>
<p>The General Manager waited for certain
wheels to turn, and then he sent for Harboro
and offered him a position as chief clerk in
one of the headquarter departments.</p>
<p>Harboro accepted the position, and said
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; and proved to be uncommonly
competent.</p>
<p>The people of Piedras Negras took a liking
to him; the women wanted to get acquainted
with him. He was invited to places, and he
accepted the invitations without either belittling
or magnifying their importance. He
got on rather well from the beginning.</p>
<p>The social affairs of Piedras Negras were
sometimes on a fairly large scale. The General
Manager had his winter residence there&mdash;a
meticulously cultivated demain which lay
like a blue spot in a cloudy sky. There were
grass and palms and, immediately beyond, the
vast desert. At night (on occasion) there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
were Chinese lanterns to add their cheerful
note to pretty revelries, while the stars lay
low and big over all the desert expanse.
The General Manager&#8217;s wife had prominent
social affiliations, and she used to bring winter
guests from the north and east&mdash;from Chicago
and New York and Boston. There were balls
and musicales, and a fine place for conversation
out on the lawn, with Mexican servants
to bring cigars and punch, and with Mexican
fiddlers to play the national airs under a fig-covered
band-stand.</p>
<p>The young people from Eagle Pass used to
go over when the General Manager&#8217;s wife
was giving one of her less formal affairs.
They were rather refreshing types: the Texas
type, with a good deal of freedom of action
and speech, once they were drawn out, and
with plenty of vigor. On these occasions
Eagle Pass merged itself into the Mexican
town, and went home late at night over the
Rio Grande bridge, and regarded life as a
romance.</p>
<p>These affairs and this variety of people
interested Harboro. He was not to be drawn
out, people soon discovered; but he liked to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
sit on the lawn and listen and take observations.
He was not backward, but his tastes
were simple. He was seemingly quite as much
at ease in the presence of a Chicago poetess
with a practised&mdash;a somewhat too practised&mdash;laugh
or a fellow employee risen, like himself,
to a point where society could see him.</p>
<p>In due course Eagle Pass gave an entertainment
(at the Mesquite Club) and invited certain
railroad officials and employees from the
other side of the river. Harboro was included
among those invited, and he put on correct
evening dress, and rode over in a coach, and
became a favorite in Eagle Pass. He seemed
rather big and serious for complete assimilation,
but he looked well with the club settings
as a background, and his name appeared later
in the week in the Eagle Pass <i>Guide</i>, in the
list headed &#8220;among those present.&#8221;</p>
<p>All of which he accepted without agitation,
or without ceasing to be Harboro himself all
over.</p>
<p>He did not meet Sylvia Little at the Mesquite
Club. If you had known Sylvia and
the Mesquite Club, you would laugh at so
superfluous a statement. Eagle Pass was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
pleasantly democratic, socially, but it could
not have been expected to stand for Sylvia.</p>
<p>People didn&#8217;t know much about her (to her
credit, at least) except that she was pretty.
She was wonderfully pretty, and in a way
which was all the more arresting when you
came to consider her desert surroundings.</p>
<p>She had come, with her father, from San
Antonio. They had taken a low, homely little
house, standing under its mesquite-tree, close
to the government reservation, where the
flagstaff stood, and the cannon boomed at
sundown, and the soldiers walked their posts.
Back of the house there was a thicket of mesquites,
and through this a path ran down to
the river.</p>
<p>The first thing people mistrusted about
Sylvia was her father. He had no visible
means of support; and if his manner was
amiable, his ways were furtive. He had a
bias in favor of Mexican associates, and
much of his time was spent down under
the river bank, where a few small wine-shops
and gambling establishments still existed in
those days. There were also rumors of drinking
and gambling orgies in the house under
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
the mesquite-tree, and people said that many
strange customers traversed that path through
the mesquite, and entered Little&#8217;s back door.
They were soldiers and railroad men, and
others of a type whose account in the bank
of society nobody ever undertakes to balance.
Sylvia was thought to be the torch which
attracted them, and it was agreed that Sylvia&#8217;s
father knew how to persuade them to drink
copiously of beverages which they paid for
themselves, and to manipulate the cards to
his own advantage in the games which were
introduced after a sufficient number of drinks
had been served.</p>
<p>Possibly a good deal of this was rumor
rather than fact: an uncharitable interpretation
of pleasures which were inelegant, certainly,
but possibly not quite vicious. Still,
it seemed to be pretty well established that
up to the time of Sylvia&#8217;s marriage her father
never worked, and that he always had money&mdash;and
this condition, on any frontier, is always
regarded with mistrust.</p>
<p>Sylvia&#8217;s prettiness was of a kind to make
your heart bleed, everything considered. She
was of a wistful type, with eager blue eyes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
and lips which were habitually parted slightly&mdash;lips
of a delicate fulness and color. Her
hair was soft and brown, and her cheeks were
of a faint, pearly rosiness. You would never
have thought of her as what people of strictly
categorical minds would call a bad woman. I
think a wholly normal man must have looked
upon her as a child looks at a heather-bell&mdash;gladly
and gratefully, and with a pleased amazement.
She was small and slight. Women of
the majordomo type must have regarded her
as still a child. Her breasts were little, her
neck and shoulders delicate, and she had a
trick of lifting her left hand to her heart when
she was startled or regarded too shrewdly, as
if she had some prescient consciousness of
coming evil.</p>
<p>She was standing by her front gate when
Harboro first saw her&mdash;and when she first saw
Harboro. The front gate commanded an unobstructed
view of the desert. It was near sundown,
and far across the earth&#8217;s floor, which
looked somewhat like a wonderful mosaic of
opals and jade at this hour, a Mexican goatherd
was driving his flock. That was the only
sign of life to be seen or felt, if you except
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
the noise of locusts in the mesquite near by
and the spasmodic progress of a horned toad
in the sand outside Sylvia&#8217;s gate.</p>
<p>Yet she was looking away to the vibrating
horizon, still as hot as an oven, as yearningly
as if at any moment a knight might ride over
the rim of the desert to rescue her, or as if a
brother were coming to put an end to the
existence of a Bluebeard who, obviously, did
not exist.</p>
<p>And then Harboro appeared&mdash;not in the
distance, but close at hand. He was passing
Sylvia&#8217;s gate. He had a natural taste for
geology, it seemed, and he had chosen this
hour to walk out beyond Eagle Pass to examine
the rock formations which had been cast
up to the surface of the desert by prehistoric
cataclysms.</p>
<p>He was close enough to Sylvia to touch her
when her presence broke down his abstraction
and drew his eyes away from whatever
object they had been observing away on the
horizon.</p>
<p>He stopped as if he had been startled. That
was a natural result of Sylvia&#8217;s appearance
here in this withered place. She was so delicately,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
fragilely abloom. Her setting should
have been some region south of the Caucasus.
Her period should have been during the
foundations of mythology. She would have
made you think of Eve.</p>
<p>And because her hand went to her heart,
and her lips parted tremulously, Harboro
stopped. It was as if he felt he must make
amends. Yet his words were the inevitable
banalities.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a fine view here,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine view!&#8221; she echoed, a little incredulously.
It was plain that she did not agree
with him. &#8220;There is plenty of sun and air,&#8221;
she conceded after a pause.</p>
<p>He rested a heavy hand on the fence.
When Harboro stopped you never had the
feeling that some of his interests had gone
on ahead and were beckoning to him. He
was always all there, as if permanently.</p>
<p>He regarded her intently. Her voice had
something of the quality of the <i>Träumerei</i> in
it, and it had affected him like a violin&#8217;s
<i>vibrato</i>, accompanying a death scene&mdash;or as a
litany might have done, had he been a religious
man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you find it too much the same,
one day after another,&#8221; he suggested, in response
to that mournful quality in her voice.
&#8220;You live here, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was looking across the desert. Where
had the goatherd hidden himself? She nodded
without bringing her glance to meet Harboro&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know a good many of the Eagle Pass
people. I&#8217;ve never seen you before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you must be a stranger,&#8221; she
replied. She brought her glance to his face
now and seemed to explore it affectionately,
as one does a new book by a favorite author.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen you before, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been to several entertainments at the
Mesquite Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! ... the Mesquite Club. I&#8217;ve never
been there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in his steadfast fashion
for a moment, and then changed the subject.
&#8220;You have rather more than your share of
shade here. I had no idea there was such a
pretty place in Eagle Pass.&#8221; He glanced at
the old mesquite-tree in the yard. It was
really quite a tree.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she assented. She added, somewhat
falteringly: &#8220;But it seems dreadfully
lonesome sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>(I do not forget that path which led from
Sylvia&#8217;s back door down to the Rio Grande,
nor the men who traversed it; yet I believe
that she spoke from her heart, and that her
words were essentially true.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re not altogether at home in
Eagle Pass: I mean, this isn&#8217;t really your
home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. We came from San Antonio a year
ago, my father and I.&#8221;</p>
<p>His glance wandered up the brick walk
to the cottage door, but if Sylvia perceived
this and knew it for a hint, she did not respond.</p>
<p>Harboro thought of other possibilities. He
turned toward the desert. &#8220;There, the sun&#8217;s
dipping down beyond that red ridge,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It will be cooler now. Won&#8217;t you walk with
me?&mdash;I&#8217;m not going far.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled happily. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to,&#8221; she admitted.</p>
<p>And so Sylvia and Harboro walked together
out toward the desert. It was, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
fact, the beginning of a series of walks, all
taken quite as informally and at about the
same hour each day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER II</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the cruder minds of Eagle Pass
made a sorry jest over the fact that nobody
&#8220;gave the bride away&#8221; when she went to
the altar&mdash;either then or during the brief
period of courtship. Her father went to the
wedding, of course; but he was not the kind
of person you would expect to participate
conspicuously in a ceremony of that sort.
He was so decidedly of the black-sheep type
that the people who assumed management of
the affair considered it only fair to Sylvia
(and to Harboro) to keep him in the background.
Sylvia had never permitted Harboro
to come to the house to see her. She
had drawn a somewhat imaginary figure in
lieu of a father to present to Harboro&#8217;s mind&#8217;s
eye. Her father (she said) was not very well
and was inclined to be disagreeable. He did
not like the idea of his daughter getting married.
She was all he had, and he was fearfully
lonesome at times.</p>
<p>Harboro had accepted all this readily. He
had asked no questions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>And so Little went to the wedding. He
went early so that he could get a seat over
against the wall, where he wouldn&#8217;t be too
conspicuous. He looked decidedly like an
outsider, and, as a matter of fact, a good many
people did not recognize him as Sylvia&#8217;s father.
He was probably regarded as a stranger who
had drifted into the church to enjoy the familiar
yet interesting spectacle of a man and
a maid bound together by a rite which was
the more interesting because it seemed so
ephemeral, yet meant so much.</p>
<p>Several of the young women of Eagle Pass
had aided Sylvia in getting ready to meet her
husband-to-be at the altar. They were well-known
girls, acting with the aid (and in the
company) of their mothers. They did not
admit even to one another what it was that
separated Sylvia from their world. Perhaps
they did not fully understand. They did
know that Sylvia was not one of them; but
they felt sorry for her, and they enjoyed the
experience of arraying her as a bride and of
constituting, for the moment, a pretty and
irreproachable setting for her wistful person.
They were somewhat excited, too. They had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the feeling that they were helping to set a
mouse-trap to catch a lion&mdash;or something like
that.</p>
<p>And after the wedding Mr. and Mrs. Harboro
emerged from the church into the clear
night, under the stars, and went afoot in the
direction of their new home&mdash;an attractive
structure which Harboro had had erected on
what was called the Quemado Road.</p>
<p>A good many of the guests looked after
them, and then at each other, but of definite
comment there was mighty little.</p>
<p>Sylvia&#8217;s father went back to his house alone.
He was not seen in the Maverick Bar that
night, nor for quite a number of succeeding
nights. He had never had any experiences
in Eagle Pass which proved him to be a courageous
man&mdash;or to lack courage; but in all
probability a sensation akin to fear bothered
him more or less during those first days and
nights after his daughter had got married.</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been better for
Sylvia if he had brazened it out just at that
time, for on the very night of the wedding
there was talk in the Maverick Bar. Not
open or general comment, certainly. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
border folk were not loose of speech. But
two young fellows whose social versatility included
membership in the Mesquite Club, on
the one side, and a free and easy acquaintance
with habitués of the Maverick Bar on
the other, sat over against the wall behind a
card-table and spoke in lowered tones. They
pretended to be interested in the usual movements
of the place. Two or three cowboys
from Thompson&#8217;s ranch were &#8220;spending&#8221; and
pressing their hospitality upon all and sundry.
A group of soldiers from the post were present,
and Jesus Mendoza, a Mexican who had
accumulated a competency by corralling his
inebriated fellow countrymen at election times,
and knowing far more about the ticket they
voted than they could ever have learned, was
resting a spurred boot on the bar railing, and
looking through dreamy eyes and his own
cloud of cigarette smoke at the front door.
Mendoza always created the impression of
being interested in something that was about
to happen, or somebody who was about to
appear&mdash;but never in his immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad somebody couldn&#8217;t have told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
him,&#8221; Blanchard, of the Eagle Pass bank, was
saying to the other man behind the card-table.
The conversation had begun by each
asking the other why he wasn&#8217;t up at the
wedding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; assented Dunwoodie, the other man.
He was a young lawyer whose father had recently
died in Belfast, leaving him money
enough to quench a thirst which always
flourished, but which never resulted in even
partial disqualification, either for business or
pleasure. &#8220;Yes, but Harboro is.... Say,
Blanchard, did you ever know another chap
like Harboro?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say I know him very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;that&#8217;s it. Nobody does. He
won&#8217;t let you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that, quite. I have an idea
there just isn&#8217;t much to know. His size and
good looks mislead you. He doesn&#8217;t say
much, probably because he hasn&#8217;t much to
say. I&#8217;ve never thought of there being any
mystery. His behavior in this affair proves
that there isn&#8217;t much of the right kind of
stuff in him. He&#8217;s had every chance. The
railroad people pushed him right along into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
a good thing, and the women across the river&mdash;the
best of them&mdash;were nice to him. I have
an idea the&mdash;er&mdash;new Mrs. Harboro will recall
some of us to a realization of a truth
which we&#8217;re rather proud of ignoring, down
here on the river: I mean, that we&#8217;ve no business
asking people about their antecedents.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunwoodie shook his head. &#8220;I figure it
out differently. I think he&#8217;s really a big
chap. He won all the fellows over in the
railroad offices&mdash;and he was pushed over the
heads of some of them when he was given
that chief clerkship. And then the way he&#8217;s
got of standing up to the General Manager
and the other magnates. And you&#8217;ll notice
that if you ever ask him a question he&#8217;ll give
you an answer that sets you to thinking. He
seems to work things out for himself. His
mind doesn&#8217;t just run along the channel of
traditions. I like him all the better because
he&#8217;s not given to small talk. If there was
anything worth while to talk about, I&#8217;ll bet
you&#8217;d always find him saying something worth
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right about his not being strong
about traditions. There&#8217;s the matter of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
marriage. Maybe he knows all about Sylvia&mdash;and
doesn&#8217;t care. He <i>must</i> know about
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a mistake on that score. I&#8217;ve
seen them together. He reveres her. You
can imagine his wanting to spread a cloak
for her at every step&mdash;as if she were too pure
to come into contact with the earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But good God, man! There&#8217;s a path to
her back door, worn there by fellows who
would tremble like a colt in the presence of a
lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dunwoodie frowned whimsically. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
say a path. It must be just a trail&mdash;a more
or less indistinct trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blanchard looked almost excited. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
<i>path</i>, I tell you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then both men laughed suddenly&mdash;though
in Dunwoodie&#8217;s laughter there was a
note of deprecation and regret.

<p>CHAPTER III</p>
</div>

<p>And so Harboro and Sylvia went home to
the house on the Quemado Road without
knowing that the town had washed its hands
of them.</p>
<p>Harboro had made certain arrangements
which were characteristic of him, perhaps,
and which nobody knew anything about.
For example, he had employed the most presentable
Mexican woman he could find, to
make the house homelike. He had taken a
little sheaf of corn-husks away from her so
that she could not make any cigarettes for a
day or two, and he had read her a patient
lecture upon ways and means of making a lot
of furniture look as if it had some direct relationship
with human needs and pleasures.
And he had advised and aided her in the preparation
of a wedding supper for two. He had
ordered grapes from Parras, and figs&mdash;black
figs, a little withered, and candied <i>tunas.</i>
And there was a roast of beef with herbs and
chili sauce, and <i>enchalades.</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>The electric lights were turned on up-stairs
and down when they entered the house,
and Sylvia had an alarmed moment when she
pictured a lot of guests waiting for them.
But there proved to be nobody in the house
but just they two and the old Mexican
woman. Antonia, her name was.</p>
<p>Harboro took her by the hand and led her
up-stairs to the door of her room. It didn&#8217;t
occur to him that Antonia might better have
attended to this part of the welcoming. Antonia
was busy, and she was not the sort of
person to mother a bride, Harboro thought.
She wouldn&#8217;t have been asked to perform this
task in any case. You would have thought
that Harboro was dealing with a child rather
than a woman&mdash;his wife. It seemed the
most natural thing in the world for him to
take complete charge of her from the beginning.</p>
<p>She uttered a little cry when she entered
the bedroom. There by the bed was her
trunk, which she had left at home. She
hadn&#8217;t known anything about its having been
transferred from one house to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who brought it?&#8221; she asked, startled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I sent for it,&#8221; explained Harboro. &#8220;I
knew you&#8217;d want it the first thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t go to the house?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no. I sent the expressman to the
house and instructed him to ask for your
things. I suppose he met your father. It&#8217;s
all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously. There was a
little furrow in her forehead. &#8220;Do you always
do things&mdash;that way?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t appear to understand what she
meant. He had other things on his mind.
He stood away from her, by the door. &#8220;If I
were you I&#8217;d take off that&mdash;harness,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It makes you look like a picture&mdash;or a sacrifice.
Do you know the old Aztec legends?
It would be nicer for you to look just like a
little woman now. Put on one of the dresses
you wore when we walked together. How
does that strike you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will.&#8221; She looked after him as if
she were a little bewildered as he turned away,
and closed the door. She heard him call
back: &#8220;I&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s anything I can do
for Antonia. Supper will be ready when you
come down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>It seemed to her that his conduct was very
strange for a lover. He was so entirely
matter-of-fact. Yet everything about him
seemed to be made up of kindness&mdash;to radiate
comfort. She had never known any other
man like this, she reflected. And then an unfamiliar
light dawned upon her. She had had
lovers before, certainly; but she realized now,
with a deep and strange sensation, that she
had never really been loved until Harboro
came.</p>
<p>She had some difficulty in getting out of
her wedding-finery. There was a momentary
temptation to call for help. But she thought
better of this, and in the end she came down-stairs
like a girl, in a light, clinging dress of
Chinese silk, with a girdle and tassel at the
waist, and a red ribbon woven into the throat.
You might have thought she was seventeen
or eighteen. As a matter of fact, she was
only twenty-two.</p>
<p>Harboro met her and kissed her, and led
her to the table. He had a forceful manner.
He was hungry, and it seemed that his efficiency
extended to a knowledge of how a
dinner should be served.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>He took his seat at the end of the table
where the roast was, and the carving implements.
At Sylvia&#8217;s place there was a percolator,
and the coffee-cups, and the sugar
and cream.</p>
<p>Antonia, wizened and dark, came and went
silently. To the people of her race a wedding
means a <i>fiesta</i>, a village hubbub, a dance, and
varying degrees of drunkenness. She was not
herself in this house of a wedding supper for
two, and a prosaic attitude toward the one
event in life when money ought to be spent
freely, even in the face of impending bankruptcy.</p>
<p>But Harboro speedily set her at ease. They
were there to eat their supper&mdash;that was all
there was to it. He wasn&#8217;t drinking toasts,
or making love. He seemed thoroughly contented;
and it didn&#8217;t occur to him, clearly,
that there was any occasion for making a
noise or simulating an excitement which he
did not feel.</p>
<p>Antonia regarded him furtively, from over
his shoulder, as she waited for Sylvia&#8217;s plate
with its portion of the roast. He was a
strange <i>hombre.</i> Well, she had known big,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
quiet men before. They were like rocks. It
was all very well for a woman if she stood
behind such a man for protection as long as
she remained quiet; but Heaven help her if
she ever undertook to beat him with her fists.
She would only break her hands and accomplish
nothing else whatever.</p>
<p>Sylvia was not in a mood, seemingly, to eat
very heartily; but Harboro thought he understood
that, and he made allowances. He did
not urge her, unless reassuring tones and
comfortable topics may be said to consist of
urging.</p>
<p>He regarded her with bright eyes when she
poured the coffee; and when her hands trembled
he busied himself with trifles so that he
would not seem to notice. He produced a
cigar and cut the end off with his penknife,
and lit it deliberately.</p>
<p>Only once&mdash;just before they got up from
the table&mdash;did he assume the rôle of lover.
He turned to Antonia, and with an air of
pride and contentment, asked the old woman,
in her own language:</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she a beautiful child?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sylvia was startled by his manner of speaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Spanish. Everybody along the border
spoke the language a little; but Harboro&#8217;s
wasn&#8217;t the canteen Spanish of most border
Americans. Accent and enunciation were
singularly nice and distinct. His mustache
bristled rather fiercely over one or two of
the words.</p>
<p>Antonia thought very highly of the &#8220;child,&#8221;
she admitted. She was <i>bonisima</i>, and other
superlatives.</p>
<p>And then Harboro&#8217;s manner became rather
brisk again. &#8220;Come, I want to show you
the house,&#8221; he said, addressing his wife.</p>
<p>He had taken a great deal of pride in the
planning and construction of the house.
There was a young Englishman in one of the
shops&mdash;a draftsman&mdash;who had studied architecture
in a London office, and who might
have been a successful architect but for a
downfall which had converted him, overnight,
into a remittance-man and a fairly competent
employee of the Mexican International. And
this man and Harboro had put their heads
together and considered the local needs and
difficulties, and had finally planned a house
which would withstand northers and lesser
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
sand-storms, and the long afternoons&#8217; blazing
sun, to the best advantage. A little garden
had been planned, too. There was hydrant
water in the yard. And there was a balcony,
looking to the west, over the garden.</p>
<p>She preceded him up-stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;First I want to show you your own room,&#8221;
said Harboro. &#8220;What do you call it? I
mean the room in which the lady of the house
sits and is contented.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine what there was in this description
which gave Sylvia a hint as to his
meaning, but she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A boudoir?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harboro answered promptly: &#8220;That&#8217;s
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The boudoir was at the front of the house,
up-stairs, overlooking the Quemado Road. It
made Sylvia&#8217;s eyes glisten. It contained a
piano, and a rather tiny divan in russet
leather, and maple-wood furniture, and electric
fixtures which made you think of little
mediæval lanterns. But the bride looked at
these things somewhat as if she were inspecting
a picture, painted in bold strokes: as if
they would become obscure if she went too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
close&mdash;as if they couldn&#8217;t possibly be hers
to be at home among.</p>
<p>It did not appear that Harboro was beginning
to feel the absence of a spontaneous
acceptance on the part of his wife. Perhaps he
was rather full of his own pleasure just then.</p>
<p>They closed the door of the boudoir behind
them after they had completed their inspection,
and at another door Harboro paused
impressively.</p>
<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he said, pushing the door open
wide, &#8220;is the guest-chamber.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would have been small wonder if Sylvia
had felt suddenly cold as she crossed that
threshold. Certainly she seemed a little
strange as she stood with her back to Harboro
and aimlessly took in the capacious bed
and the few other simple articles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The guest-chamber?&#8221; she echoed presently,
turning toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have guests occasionally&mdash;after a
while. Friends of yours from San Antonio,
perhaps, or fellows I&#8217;ve known all the way
from here to the City. We shouldn&#8217;t want
them to go to a hotel, should we? I mean, if
they were people we really cared for?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>She went to the window and looked out;
but the gray sands, pallid under the night sky,
did not afford a soothing picture. She turned
to Harboro almost as if she were a stranger
to him. &#8220;Have you many friends?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&mdash;not enough to get in my way,
you know. I&#8217;ve never had much of a chance
for friendships&mdash;not for a good many years.
But I ought to have a better chance now.
I&#8217;ve thought you&#8217;d be able to help me in that
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not linger in the room, and Harboro
got the idea that she did not like to think of
their sharing their home with outsiders. He
understood that, too. &#8220;Of course we&#8217;re going
to be by ourselves for a long time to come.
There shall not be any guests until you feel
you&#8217;d like to have them.&#8221; Then, as her eyes
still harbored a shadow, he exclaimed gaily:
&#8220;We&#8217;ll pretend that we haven&#8217;t any guest-chamber
at all!&#8221; And taking a bunch of
keys from his pocket he locked the door with
a decisive movement.</p>
<p>On the way down the hall they passed their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
bedroom. &#8220;This room you&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;our room. But you have not seen the balcony
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was plainly confident that the balcony
would make a pleasant impression upon her.
He opened yet another door, and they stepped
out under the night sky.</p>
<p>The thing had been planned with certain
poetic or romantic values in mind. Standing
on the balcony you were looking toward the
Rio Grande&mdash;and Mexico. And you seemed
pretty high. There was the dull silver of the
river, and the line of lights along the bridge,
and beyond the huddled, dark structures of
Piedras Negras. You might have imagined
yourself on the deck of a Mediterranean
steamer, looking at a town in Algeria or Tunis.
And beyond, under the low-hanging stars,
was the Mexican desert&mdash;a blank page, with
only here and there the obscurity of a garden,
or a <i>hacienda</i>, or a mere speck which would
be a lonely casa built of earth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it?&#8221; he asked. He had
seated himself with a sigh of contentment.
His outstretched arms lay along the back of
the settee, and he was looking at her eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>Yes, she said, it was nice.... &#8220;It is
strange that he should be thinking of the
view just now,&#8221; she was saying to herself.
A painful turmoil raged within her; but outwardly
she was so calm that Harboro was
puzzled. To him, too, that view became a
negative thing for the moment. &#8220;I suspect
that house down under the mesquite-tree was
a bit shabby,&#8221; he was thinking. &#8220;She&#8217;s oppressed
by so many new things.&#8221; He gave
her time to find her bearings. That was a
thing she would do better by being left
alone.</p>
<p>And out of the chaos in Sylvia&#8217;s mind there
came the clear realization that Harboro was
not living for the moment, but that he was
looking forward, planning for a lifetime, and
not for a swift, passing storm of passion.
There was something static in his nature;
there was a stability in the house he had provided
and furnished. Her experiences with
him were not to be like a flame: sanctioned,
yet in all other respects like other experiences
she had had in the past.</p>
<p>The silence between them had become uncomfortable&mdash;inappropriate;
and Harboro put
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
a gentle arm about her and drew her closer
to him. &#8220;Sit down by me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He was dismayed by the result of that persuasive
movement. The hand he had taken
into his trembled, and she would not yield to
the pressure of his arm. She hung her head
as if desolate memories were crowding between
him and her, and he saw that moisture
glistened in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; he inquired huskily, &#8220;you&#8217;re not
afraid of me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She allowed him to draw her closer, and he
felt the negative movement of her head as it
lay on his shoulder; but he knew that she
<i>was</i> afraid, though he did not gauge the
quality of her fear. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t be afraid,
you know.&#8221; He continued the pressure of
his arm until she seemed to relax wholly
against him. He felt a delicious sense of
conquest over her by sympathy and gentleness.
He was eager for that moment to
pass, though he held it precious and knew
that it would never return again. Then he
felt her body tremble as it lay against his.</p>
<p>&#8220;That won&#8217;t do!&#8221; he chided gently.
&#8220;Look!&#8221; He stood her on her feet before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
him, and took her arms at the elbows, pinioning
them carefully to her sides. Then he
slowly lifted her above him, so that he had
to raise his face to look into hers. The act
was performed as if it were a rite.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean ... I am helpless?&#8221; She
checked the manifestation of grief as abruptly
as a child does when its mind has been swiftly
diverted.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless me, no! I mean anything but
that. That&#8217;s just what I <i>don&#8217;t</i> mean. I
mean that you&#8217;re to have all the help you
want&mdash;that you&#8217;re to look to me for your
strength, that you are to put your burdens
on me.&#8221; He placed her on the seat beside
him and took one of her hands in both his.
&#8220;There, now, we&#8217;ll talk. You see, we&#8217;re one,
you and I. That isn&#8217;t just a saying of the
preachers. It&#8217;s a fact. I couldn&#8217;t harm you
without harming myself. Don&#8217;t you see that?
Nobody could harm you without harming me,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not notice that her hand stiffened
in his at those words.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we&#8217;ve been together awhile we&#8217;ll
both realize in wonderful ways what it means
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
really to be united. When you&#8217;ve laid your
head on my shoulder a great many times, or
against my heart, the very blood in my veins
will be the blood in your veins. I can&#8217;t explain
it. It goes beyond physiology. We&#8217;ll
belong to each other so completely that
wherever you go I shall be with you, and when
I go to work I shall have only to put my
hand on my breast to touch you. I&#8217;ll get
my strength from you, and it shall be yours
again in return. There, those are things
which will come to us little by little. But
you must never be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would rather not even try to surmise
what was in Sylvia&#8217;s mind when, following
those words of his, she swiftly took his face
in her hands with unsuspected strength and
hungrily kissed him. But Harboro read no
dark meaning into the caress. It seemed to
him the natural thing for her to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER IV</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro adopted the plan, immediately
after his marriage, of walking to his work in
the morning and back to his home in the
evening. It was only a matter of a mile or
so, and if you kept out of the sun of midday,
it was a pleasant enough form of exercise.
Indeed, in the morning it was the sort of
thing a man of varied experiences might have
been expected to enjoy: the walk through
Eagle Pass, with a glimpse of the Dolch hotel
bus going to meet the early train from Spofford
Junction, and a friendly greeting from
an occasional merchant, and then the breezy
passage across the Rio Grande bridge, spanning
the meandering waters which never
bore vessels of any sort to the far-off sea,
and finally the negotiation of the narrow
street in Piedras Negras, past the plaza and
the bull-ring, and countless little wine-shops,
and the market, with its attractively displayed
fruits and vegetables from nobody
knew where.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>But it is not to be denied that his practice
of making this journey to and fro afoot was
not without its prejudicial result. The people
of quality of either side of the river rarely
ever set foot on the bridge, or on those malodorous
streets of Piedras Negras which lay
near the river. Such people employed a
<i>cochero</i> and drove, quite in the European
style, when business or pleasure drew them
from their homes. There was an almost
continuous stream of <i>peones</i> on the bridge
in the mornings and evenings: silent, furtive
people, watched closely by the customs guard,
whose duties required him on occasion to examine
a suspicious-appearing Mexican with
decidedly indelicate thoroughness. And all
this did not tend to make the bridge a popular
promenade.</p>
<p>But Harboro was not squeamish, nor did
he entertain slavish thoughts of how people
would feel over a disregarded custom. He
liked simplicity, and moreover he felt the
need of exercise now that his work kept him
inactive most of the time. He was at an
age when men take on flesh easily.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, people weren&#8217;t favorably impressed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
when they looked down from their
old-fashioned equipages on their ride between
the two republics, and caught a glimpse of
the chief clerk marching along the bridge
railing&mdash;often, as likely as not, in company
with some chance laborer or wanderer, whose
garb clearly indicated his lowly estate.</p>
<p>And when, finally, Harboro persuaded Sylvia
to accompany him on one of these walks of
his, the limits of his eccentricity were thought
to have been reached. Indeed, not a few
people, who might have been induced to
forget that his marriage had been a scandalous
one, were inclined for the first time to
condemn him utterly when he required the
two towns to contemplate him in company
with the woman he had married, both of
them running counter to all the conventions.</p>
<p>The reason for this trip of Harboro&#8217;s and
Sylvia&#8217;s was that Harboro wanted Sylvia to
have a new dress for a special occasion.</p>
<p>It happened that two or three weeks after
his marriage Harboro came upon an interesting
bit of intelligence in the Eagle Pass
<i>Guide</i>, the town&#8217;s weekly newspaper. It was
a Saturday afternoon (the day of the paper&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
publication), and Harboro had gone up to
the balcony overlooking the garden. He had
carried the newspaper with him. He did
not expect to find anything in the chronicles
of local happenings, past or prospective, that
would interest him. But there was always
a department of railroad news&mdash;consisting
mainly of personal items&mdash;which had for him
the quality of a letter from home.</p>
<p>Sylvia was down-stairs at work in the
dining-room, directing the efforts of old Antonia.
Perhaps I should say that she was
extraordinarily happy. I doubt very much
if she had come to contemplate the married
state through Harboro&#8217;s eyes; but she seemed
to have feared that an avalanche would fall&mdash;and
none had fallen. Harboro had manifested
an unswerving gentleness toward her,
and she had begun to &#8220;let down,&#8221; as swimmers
say, with confidence in her ability to
find bottom and attain the shore.</p>
<p>When at length she went up to the balcony
to tell Harboro that supper was ready, she
stood arrested by the pleasantly purposeful
expression in his eyes. She had learned,
rather creditably, to anticipate him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are to have a new dress,&#8221; he announced.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.... Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see here&#8221;&mdash;he tapped the paper on his
knee&mdash;&#8220;that they&#8217;re getting ready for their
first dance of the winter at the Mesquite
Club.&#8221;</p>
<p>She forgot herself. &#8220;But <i>we&#8217;re</i> not invited!&#8221;
she said, frankly incredulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why no, not yet. But we shall be. Why
shouldn&#8217;t we be?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand went to her heart in the old wistful
way. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know ... I just thought
we shouldn&#8217;t be. Those affairs are for ...
I&#8217;ve never thought they would invite me to
one of their dances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! They&#8217;ve invited me. Now
they&#8217;ll invite <i>us</i>. I suppose the best milliners
are across the river, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed unwilling to meet his eyes. &#8220;I
believe some women get their dresses made
over there, and wear them back to this side&mdash;so
they needn&#8217;t pay any duty. That is, if
they&#8217;re to be handsome dresses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this is going to be a handsome dress.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed pleased, undeniably; yet she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
changed the subject with evident relief. &#8220;Antonia
will be cross if we don&#8217;t go right down.
And you must remember to praise the <i>enchalades</i>.
She&#8217;s tried with them ever so
hard.&#8221; This wasn&#8217;t an affectation on Sylvia&#8217;s
part. She was a good-hearted girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to be a handsome dress,&#8221; repeated
Harboro an hour later, when they had returned
to the balcony. It was dusk now,
and little tapers of light were beginning to
burn here and there in the desert: small,
open fires where Mexican women were cooking
their suppers of dried goat&#8217;s meat and
<i>frijoles</i>.</p>
<p>Said Sylvia: &#8220;If only.... Does it matter
so much to you that they should invite us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It matters to me on your account. Such
things are yours by right. You wouldn&#8217;t be
happy always with me alone. We must think
of the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sylvia took his hand and stroked it thoughtfully.
There <i>were</i> moments when she hungered
for a bit of the comedy of life: laughter
and other youthful noises. The Mexican
<i>bailes</i> and their humble feasts were delightful;
and the song of the violins, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
odor of smoke, and the innocent rivalries,
and the night air. But the Mesquite
Club....</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we could go on the way we are,&#8221;
she said finally, with a sigh of contentment&mdash;and
regret.

<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER V</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro insisted upon her going across
the river with him the next day, a Sunday.
It was now late in October, but you wouldn&#8217;t
have realized it unless you had looked at the
calendar. The sun was warm&mdash;rather too
warm. The air was extraordinarily clear.
It was an election year and the town had been
somewhat disorderly the night before. Harboro
and Sylvia had heard the noises from
their balcony: singing, first, and then shouting.
And later drunken Mexicans had ridden
past the house and on out the Quemado Road.
A Mexican who is the embodiment of taciturnity
when afoot, will become a howling
organism when he is mounted.</p>
<p>Harboro had telephoned to see if an appointment
could be made&mdash;to a madame somebody
whose professional card he had found
in the <i>Guide</i>. And he had been assured that
monsieur would be very welcome on a Sunday.</p>
<p>Sylvia was glad that it was not on a weekday,
and that it was in the forenoon, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
she would be required to make her first public
appearance with her husband. The town
would be practically deserted, save by a few
better-class young men who might be idling
about the drug-store. They wouldn&#8217;t know
her, and if they did, they would behave circumspectly.
Strangely enough, it was Sylvia&#8217;s
conviction that men are nearly all good
creatures.</p>
<p>As it fell out it was Harboro and not Sylvia
who was destined to be humiliated that day&mdash;a
fact which may not seem strange to the
discerning.</p>
<p>They had got as far as the middle of the
Rio Grande bridge without experiencing anything
which marred the general effect of a
stage set for a Passion Play&mdash;but with the
actors missing; and then they saw a carriage
approaching from the Mexican side.</p>
<p>Harboro knew the horses. They were the
General Manager&#8217;s. And presently he recognized
the coachman. The horses were moving
at a walk, very slowly; but at length
Harboro recognized the General Manager&#8217;s
wife, reclining under a white silk sunshade and
listening to the vivacious chatter of a young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
woman by her side. They would be coming
over to attend the services in the Episcopal
church in Eagle Pass, Harboro realized.
Then he recognized the young woman, too.
He had met her at one of the affairs to which
he had been invited. He recalled her as a
girl whose voice was too high-pitched for a
reposeful effect, and who created the impression
that she looked upon the social life of
the border as a rather amusing adventure.</p>
<p>You might have supposed that they considered
themselves the sole occupants of the
world as they advanced, perched on their
high seat; and this, Harboro realized, was
the true fashionable air. It was an instinct
rather than a pose, he believed, and he was
pondering that problem in psychology which
has to do with the fact that when people ride
or drive they appear to have a different mental
organism from those who walk.</p>
<p>Then something happened. The carriage
was now almost at hand, and Harboro saw
the coachman turn his head slightly, as if to
hear better. Then he leaned forward and
rattled the whip in its place, and the horses
set off at a sharp trot. There was a rule
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
against trotting on the bridge, but there are
people everywhere who are not required to
observe rules.</p>
<p>Harboro paused, ready to lift his hat. He
liked the General Manager&#8217;s wife. But the
occupants of the carriage passed without seeing
him. And Harboro got the impression
that there was something determined in the
casual air with which the two women looked
straight before them. He got an odd feeling
that the most finely tempered steel of all lies
underneath the delicate golden filigree of social
custom and laws.</p>
<p>He was rather pleased at a conclusion which
came to him: people of that kind really <i>did</i>
see, then. They only pretended not to see.
And then he felt the blood pumping through
the veins in his neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Sylvia, with that
directness which Harboro comprehended and
respected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, those ladies ... they didn&#8217;t seem
quite the type you&#8217;d expect to see here, did
they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s every type here,&#8221; she replied
lightly. She turned her eyes away from Harboro.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
There was something in his face which
troubled her. She could not bear to see him
with that expression of wounded sensibilities
and rebellious pride in his eyes. And she had
understood everything.</p>
<p>She did not break in upon his thoughts
soon. She would have liked to divert his
mind, but she felt like a culprit who realizes
that words are often betrayers.</p>
<p>And so they walked in silence up that narrow
bit of street which connects the bridge
with Piedras Negras, and leads you under
the balcony of what used to be the American
Consul&#8217;s house, and on past the <i>cuartel</i>, where
the imprisoned soldiers are kept. Here, of
course, the street broadens and skirts the
plaza where the band plays of an evening,
and where the town promenades round and
round the little square of palms and fountains,
under the stars. You may remember that a
little farther on, on one side of the plaza,
there is the immense church which has been
building for a century, more or less, and
which is still incomplete.</p>
<p>There were a few miserable-looking soldiers,
with shapeless, colorless uniforms, loitering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
in front of the <i>cuartel</i> as Harboro and Sylvia
passed.</p>
<p>The indefinably sinister character of the
building affected Sylvia. &#8220;What is it?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s where the republic keeps a body of
its soldiers,&#8221; explained Harboro. &#8220;They&#8217;re
inside&mdash;locked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were both glad to sit down on one of
the plaza benches for a few minutes; they did
so by a common impulse, without speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I ever thought of prisoners
having what you&#8217;d call an honorable
profession,&#8221; Sylvia said slowly. She gazed
at the immense, low structure with troubled
eyes. Flags fluttered from the ramparts at
intervals, but they seemed oddly lacking in
gallantry or vitality.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a barbarous custom,&#8221; said Harboro
shortly. He was still thinking of that incident
on the bridge.</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet ... you might think of them as
happy, living that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious! Happy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They needn&#8217;t care about how they are to
be provided for&mdash;and they have their duties.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re <i>prisoners</i>, Sylvia!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, prisoners.... Aren&#8217;t we all prisoners,
somehow? I&#8217;ve sometimes thought
that none of us can do just what we&#8217;d like
to do, or come or go freely. We think we&#8217;re
free, as oxen in a treadmill think of themselves
as being free, I suppose. We think we&#8217;re
climbing a long hill, and that we&#8217;ll get to the
top after a while. But at sundown the gate
is opened and the oxen are released. They&#8217;ve
never really gotten anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned to her with the stanch optimism
she had grown accustomed to in him. &#8220;A
pagan doctrine, that,&#8221; he said spiritedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pagan doctrine.... I wonder what
that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pagans are people who don&#8217;t believe in
God. I am not speaking of the God of the
churches, exactly. I mean a good influence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t they believe in their own gods?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt. But you might call their own
gods bad influences, as often as not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&mdash;perhaps they&#8217;re just simple folk who
believe in their own experiences.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had the troubled feeling that her intuitions,
her fatalistic leanings, were giving her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
a surer grasp of the subject than his, which
was based upon a rather nebulous, logical
process that often brought him to confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only know that I am free,&#8221; he declared
doggedly.</p>
<p>The sun had warmed her to an almost
vagrant mood. Her smile was delicate
enough, yet her eyes held a gentle taunt as
she responded: &#8220;Not a bit of it; you have a
wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A wife&mdash;yes; and that gives me ten times
the freedom I ever had before. A man is
like a bird with only one wing&mdash;before he
finds a wife. His wife becomes his other
wing. There isn&#8217;t any height beyond him,
when he has a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>She placed her hands on her cheeks. &#8220;Two
wings!&#8221; she mused.... &#8220;What&#8217;s between
the wings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A heart, you may say, if you will. Or a
soul. A capacity. Words are fashioned by
scholars&mdash;dull fellows. But you know what
I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the hidden depths of the <i>cuartel</i> a
silver bugle-note sounded, and Sylvia looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
to see if the soldiers sitting out in front would
go away; but they did not do so. She arose.
&#8220;Would you mind going into the church a
minute?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, anybody can go into those churches,&#8221;
she responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody can go into <i>any</i> church.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose so. What I mean is that
these old Catholic churches seem different.
In our own churches you have a feeling of
being&mdash;what do you say?&mdash;personally conducted.
As if you were a visitor being shown
children&#8217;s trinkets. There is something impersonal&mdash;something boundless&mdash;in churches
like this one here. The silence makes you
think that there is nobody in them&mdash;or that
perhaps ... God isn&#8217;t far away.&#8221;</p>
<p>He frowned. &#8220;But this is just where the
trinkets are&mdash;in these churches: the images,
the painted figures, the robes, the whole mysterious
paraphernalia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes ... but when there isn&#8217;t anything
going on. You feel an influence. I remember
going into a church in San Antonio once&mdash;a Protestant chapel, and the only thing I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
could recall afterward was a Yankee clock
that ticked too fast and too loud. I never
heard of anything so horribly inappropriate.
Time was what you thought of. Not eternity.
You felt that the people would be afraid of
wasting a minute too much&mdash;as if their real
concerns were elsewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro was instinctively combating the
thought that was in her mind, so far as there
was a definite thought, and as far as he understood
it. &#8220;But why shouldn&#8217;t there be a
clock?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;If people feel that they
ought to give a certain length of time to worship,
and then go back to their work again,
why shouldn&#8217;t they have a clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she conceded;
and then, with a faint smile: &#8220;Yes, if it
didn&#8217;t tick too loud.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lowered her voice abruptly on the last
word. They had passed across the doorless
portal and were in the presence of a group of
silent, kneeling figures: wretched women
whose heads were covered with black cotton
<i>rebozos</i>, who knelt and faced the distant altar.
They weren&#8217;t in rows. They had settled
down just anywhere. And there were men:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
swarthy, ill-shapen, dejected. Their lips
moved noiselessly.</p>
<p>Harboro observed her a little uneasily.
Her sympathy for this sort of thing was new
to him. But she made none of the customary
signs of fellowship, and after a brief interval
she turned and led the way back into
the sunshine.</p>
<p>He was still regarding her strangely when
she paused, just outside the door, and opened
a little hand-bag which depended from her
arm. She was quite intently devoted to a
search for something. Presently she produced
a coin, and then Harboro observed for
the first time that the tortured figure of a
beggar sat in the sun outside the church door.</p>
<p>Sylvia leaned over with an impassive face
and dropped the coin into the beggar&#8217;s cup.</p>
<p>She chanced to glance at Harboro&#8217;s face
an instant later, and she was dismayed a
little by its expression: that of an almost
violent distaste. What did it mean? Was
it because she had given a coin to the beggar?
There could have been no other reason. But
why should he look as if her action had contaminated
her in some fashion&mdash;as if there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
had been communication between her and
the unfortunate <i>anciano</i>? As if there had
been actual contact?</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t have done that?&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I shouldn&#8217;t have done it,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think why. The wretched creature&mdash;I
should have felt troubled if I&#8217;d ignored
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a profession. It&#8217;s as much a part
of the national customs as dancing and drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. A profession ... but isn&#8217;t
that all the more reason why we should give
him a little help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A reason why you should permit yourself
to be imposed upon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help thinking further than that.
After all, it&#8217;s he and his kind that must have
been imposed upon in the beginning. It&#8217;s
being a profession makes me believe that all
the people who might have helped him, who
might have given him a chance to be happy
and respectable, really conspired against him
in some way. You have to believe that it&#8217;s
the rule that some must be comfortable and
some wretched.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A beggar is a beggar,&#8221; said Harboro.
&#8220;And he was filthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you suppose he&#8217;d rather be the
proprietor of a wine-shop, or something of
that sort, if he had had any choice?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well.... It&#8217;s not a simple matter, of
course. I&#8217;m glad you did what you felt you
ought to do.&#8221; It occurred to Harboro that
he was setting up too much opposition to her
whims&mdash;whims which seemed rooted in her
principles as well as her impulses. It was as
if their minds were of different shapes: hers
circular, his square; so that there could be
only one point of contact between them&mdash;that
one point being their love for each other.
There would be a fuller conformity after
a while, he was sure. He must try to understand
her, to get at her odd point of view.
She might be right occasionally, when they
were in disagreement.</p>
<p>He touched her lightly on the shoulder.
&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we ought to be getting on to the
madame&#8217;s,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER VI</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro would have made you think of
a bear in a toy-shop when he sat down in
the tiny front room of Madame Boucher&#8217;s
millinery establishment. He was uncomfortably,
if vaguely, conscious of the presence
of many hats, displayed on affairs which were
like unfinished music-racks.</p>
<p>He had given Madame Boucher certain
instructions&mdash;or perhaps liberties would be a
better word. Mrs. Harboro was to be shown
only the best fabrics, he told her; and no
pains were to be spared to make a dress which
would be a credit to madame&#8217;s establishment.
Madame had considered this, and him, and
had smiled. Madame&#8217;s smile had impressed
him curiously. There had been no co-operation
between lips and eyes. The eyes had
opened a little wider, as if with a stimulated
rapaciousness. The lips had opened to the
extent of a nicely achieved, symmetrical crescent
of teeth. It made Harboro think of a
carefully constructed Jack-o&#8217;-Lantern.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>Sylvia had asked him if he wouldn&#8217;t help
in making a choice, but he had looked slightly
alarmed, and had resolutely taken a seat
which afforded a view of the big <i>Casa Blanca</i>
across the way: an emporium conducted on
a big scale by Germans. He even became
oblivious to the discussion on the other side
of the partition, where Sylvia and madame
presently entered upon the preliminaries of
the business in hand.</p>
<p>The street was quite familiar to him.
There had been a year or so, long ago, when
he had &#8220;made&#8221; Piedras Negras, as railroaders
say, twice a week. He hadn&#8217;t liked the
town very well. He saw its vice rather than
its romance. He had attended one bullfight,
and had left his seat in disgust when
he saw a lot of men and women of seeming
gentility applauding a silly fellow whose sole
stock in trade was an unblushing vanity.</p>
<p>His imagination travelled on beyond the
bull-pen, to the shabby dance-halls along the
river. It was a custom for Americans to
visit the dance-halls at least once. He had
gone into them repeatedly. Other railroaders
who were his associates enjoyed going into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
these places, and Harboro, rather than be
alone in the town, had followed disinterestedly
in their wake, and had looked on with cold,
contemplative eyes at the disorderly picture
they presented: unfortunate Mexican girls
dancing with cowboys and railroaders and
soldiers and nondescripts. Three Mexicans,
with harp, violin, and &#8217;cello had supplied
the music: the everlasting national airs. It
seemed to Harboro that the whole republic
spent half its time within hearing of <i>Sobre
las Olas</i>, and <i>La Paloma</i>, and <i>La Golondrina</i>.
He had heard so much of the emotional noises
vibrating across the land that when he got
away from the throb of his engine, into some
silent place, it seemed to him that his ears
reverberated with flutes and strings, rather
than the song of steam, which he understood
and respected. He had got the impression
that music smelled bad&mdash;like stale wine and
burning corn-husks and scented tobacco and
easily perishable fruits.</p>
<p>He remembered the only woman who had
ever made an impression upon him down in
those dance-halls: an overmature creature, unusually
fair for a Mexican, who spoke a little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
English, manipulating her lips quaintly, like
a child. He recalled her favorite expression:
&#8220;My class is very fine!&#8221; She had told him
this repeatedly, enunciating the words with
delicacy. She had once said to him, commiseratingly:
&#8220;You work very hard?&#8221; And
when he had confessed that his duties were
onerous, she had brightened. &#8220;Much work,
much money,&#8221; she had said, with the avidity
of a boy who has caught a rabbit in a trap.
And Harboro had wondered where she had
got such a monstrously erroneous conception
of the law of industrialism.</p>
<p>The picture of the whirling figures came
back to him: the vapor of dust in the room,
the loud voices of men at the bar, trying to
be heard above the din of the music and the
dancing. There came back to him the memory
of a drunken cowboy, nudging the violinist&#8217;s
elbow as he played, and shouting:
&#8220;Give us <i>Dixie</i>&mdash;give us a white man&#8217;s tune&#8221;&mdash;and
the look of veiled hatred in the slumbrous
eyes of the Mexican musician, who
had inferred the insult without comprehending
the words.</p>
<p>He recalled other pictures of those nights:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
the Indian girls who might be expected to
yell in the midst of a dance if they had succeeded
in attracting the attention of a man
who usually danced with some one else. And
there were other girls with a Spanish strain
in them&mdash;girls with a drop of blood that
might have been traced back a hundred years
to Madrid or Seville or Barcelona. Small
wonder if such girls felt like shrieking too,
sometimes. Not over petty victories, and
with joy; but when their hearts broke because
the bells of memory called to them from
away in the barred windows of Spain, or in
walled gardens, or with the shepherd lovers
of Andalusia.</p>
<p>If you danced with one of them you paid
thirty cents at the bar and got a drink, while
the girl was given a check good for fifteen
cents in the trade of the place. The girls
used to cash in their checks at the end of a
night&#8217;s work at fifty cents a dozen. It wasn&#8217;t
quite fair; but then the proprietor was a
business man.</p>
<p>&#8220;My class is very fine!&#8221; The words came
back to Harboro&#8217;s mind. Good God!&mdash;what
had become of her? There had been a railroad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
man, a fellow named Peterson, who was
just gross enough to fancy her&mdash;a good chap,
too, in his way. Courageous, energetic, loyal&mdash;at
least to other men. He had occasionally
thought that Peterson meant to take the
poor, pretentious creature away from the
dance-halls and establish her somewhere. He
had not seen Peterson for years now.</p>
<p>... Sylvia emerged from behind the thin
partition, sighing and smiling. &#8220;Did it seem
very long?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to make
up your mind. It&#8217;s like taking one color out
of the rainbow and expecting it to look as
pretty as the whole rainbow. But I&#8217;m ready
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, a week from Wednesday,&#8221;
called Madame Boucher, as Harboro and Sylvia
moved toward the door.</p>
<p>Harboro looked at Sylvia inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the try-on,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ll be here.&#8221; She went out, Harboro holding
the door open for her.</p>
<p>Out on the sidewalk she almost collided
with a heavy man, an American&mdash;a gross,
blond, good-natured creature who suddenly
smiled with extreme gratification.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
&#8220;Hello!&mdash;<i>Sylvia!</i>&#8221; he cried. He seized her by the hand
and drew her close.</p>
<p>Harboro stood on the door-step and looked
down&mdash;and recognized Peterson.

<p>CHAPTER VII</p>
</div>

<p>Peterson felt the dark shadow of Harboro
immediately. He looked up into the gravely
inquiring face above him, and then he gave
voice to a new delight. &#8220;Hello!&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Harboro</span>!&#8221;
He dropped Sylvia&#8217;s hand as if she no longer
existed. An almost indefinable change of expression
occurred in his ruddy, radiant face.
It was as if his joy at seeing Sylvia had been
that which we experience in the face of a
beautiful illusion; and now, seeing Harboro,
it was as if he stood in the presence of a
cherished reality. He grasped Harboro&#8217;s
hand and dragged him down from the step.
&#8220;Old Harboro!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You two appear to have met before,&#8221;
remarked Harboro, looking with quiet inquiry
from Sylvia to Peterson, and back to
Sylvia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, in San Antonio,&#8221; she explained. It
had been in Eagle Pass, really, but she did not
want Harboro to know.</p>
<p>The smile on Peterson&#8217;s face had become
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
curiously fixed. &#8220;Yes, in San Antonio,&#8221; he
echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He knew my father,&#8221; added Sylvia.</p>
<p>&#8220;A particular friend,&#8221; said Peterson. And
then, the lines of mirth on his face becoming
a little less rigid and the color a little less
ruddy, he added to Sylvia: &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your
father occasionally talk about his old friend
<i>Peterson?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro interrupted. &#8220;At any rate, you
probably don&#8217;t know that she is Mrs. Harboro
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Peterson appeared to be living entirely
within himself for the moment. He might
have made you think of the Trojan Horse&mdash;innocuous
without, but teeming with belligerent
activity within. He seemed to be
laughing maliciously, though without movement
or noise. Then he was all frank joyousness
again. &#8220;Good!&#8221; he exclaimed. He
smote Harboro on the shoulder. &#8220;Good!&#8221;
He stood apart, vigorously erect, childishly
pleased. &#8220;Enjoying a holiday?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>And when Harboro nodded he became animated
again. &#8220;You&#8217;re both going to take
dinner with me&mdash;over at the <i>Internacional</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
We&#8217;ll celebrate. I&#8217;ve got to take my train
out in an hour&mdash;I&#8217;ve got a train now, Harboro.&#8221;
(Harboro had noted his conductor&#8217;s
uniform.) &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have time. We can
have a talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro recalled a score of fellows he had
known up and down the line, with most of
whom he had gotten out of touch. Peterson
would know about some of them. He realized
how far he had been removed from the spontaneous
joys of the railroad career since he
had been in the office. And Peterson had
always been a friendly chap, with lots of good
points.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should you like it, Sylvia?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She had liked Peterson, too. He had always
been good-natured and generous. He
had seemed often almost to understand....
&#8220;I think it would be nice,&#8221; she replied. She
was afraid there was a note of guilt in her
voice. She wished Harboro had refused to
go, without referring the matter to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could telephone to Antonia,&#8221; he said
slowly. It seemed impossible to quicken his
pulses in any way. &#8220;She needn&#8217;t get anything
ready.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could do it,&#8221; suggested Sylvia. She felt
she&#8217;d rather not be left alone with Peterson.
&#8220;I could use Madame Boucher&#8217;s telephone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Harboro had already laid his hand on
the door. &#8220;Better let me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
can do it quicker.&#8221; He knew that Antonia
would want to remonstrate, to ask questions,
and he wanted Sylvia to enjoy the occasion
whole-heartedly. He went back into the
milliner&#8217;s shop.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Peterson</i>,&#8221; said the man who remained
on the sidewalk with Sylvia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; she replied, her lips scarcely
moving, her eyes avoiding his burning glance.
&#8220;And ... in San Antonio.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were rather early for the midday
meal when they reached the <i>Internacional</i>;
indeed, they were the first to enter the dining-room.
Nevertheless the attitudes of the
Mexican waiters were sufficient assurance that
they might expect to be served immediately.</p>
<p>Peterson looked at his watch and compared
it with the clock in the dining-room. &#8220;The
train from Spofford is late,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
due now.&#8221; He pitched his head up like a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
dog. &#8220;There she is!&#8221; he exclaimed. There
was the rumble of a train crossing the bridge.
&#8220;They&#8217;ll be coming in right away.&#8221; He indicated
the empty tables by a glance.</p>
<p>Harboro knew all about the train schedules
and such matters. He knew that American
tourists bound for Mexico would be coming
over on that train, and that they would have
an hour for dinner while their baggage was
passing through the hands of the customs
officials.</p>
<p>They had given their orders and were still
waiting when the train pulled in at the station,
close at hand, and in a moment the
dining-room became noisy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel seems pretty light,&#8221; commented
Peterson. He appeared to be trying to make
conversation; he was obviously under some
sort of constraint. Still, he had the genuine
interest of the railroader in the subjects he
mentioned.</p>
<p>Harboro had not observed that there was
not even one woman among the travellers
who entered; but Peterson noted the fact,
mentioning it in the tone of one who has
been deprived of a natural right. And Harboro
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
wondered what was the matter with a
man who saw the whole world, always, solely
in relation to women. He sensed the fact
that Peterson was not entirely comfortable.
&#8220;He&#8217;s probably never grown accustomed to
being in the company of a decent woman,&#8221;
he concluded. He tried to launch the subject
of old associates. It seemed that Peterson
had been out in Durango for some time,
but he had kept in touch with most of the
fellows on the line to the City. He began to
talk easily, and Harboro was enjoying the
meeting even before the waiter came back
with their food.</p>
<p>Sylvia was ill at ease. She was glad that
Harboro and Peterson had found something
to talk about. She began to eat the amber-colored
grapes the waiter had placed before
her. She seemed absent-minded, absorbed in
her own thoughts. And then she forgot self
in the contemplation of a man and a child
who had come in and taken a table at the
other end of the dining-room. The man wore
a band of crape around his arm. The child,
a little girl of five or six, had plainly sobbed
herself into a condition verging upon stupor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
She was not eating the dinner which had
been brought to her, though she occasionally
glanced with miserable eyes at one dish or
another. She seemed unable to help herself,
and at intervals a dry sob shook her tiny
body.</p>
<p>Sylvia forgot the grapes beside her plate;
she was looking with womanly pity at that
little girl, and at the man, who seemed sunk
into the depths of despair.</p>
<p>Peterson followed her compassionate glance.
&#8220;Ah,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;it&#8217;s a chap who came
up from Paila a little while back. He had
his wife with him. She was dying, and she
wanted to be buried in Texas. I believe he&#8217;s
in some sort of business down in Paila.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spirit of compassion surrounded Sylvia
like a halo. She had just noted that the
little girl was making a stupendous effort to
conquer her sobs, to &#8220;be good,&#8221; as children
say. With a heroic resolve which would have
been creditable to a Joan of Arc, the little
thing suddenly began to try to eat from one
of the dishes, but her hands trembled so that
she was quite helpless. Her efforts seemed
about to suffer a final collapse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>And then Sylvia pushed her chair back and
arose. There was a tremulous smile on her
lips as she crossed the room. She paused by
that man with crape on his sleeve. &#8220;I wonder
if you won&#8217;t let me help,&#8221; she said. Her
voice would have made you think of rue, or
of April rain. She knelt beside the child&#8217;s
chair and possessed herself of a tiny hand
with a persuasive gentleness that would have
worked miracles. Her face was uplifted, soft,
beaming, bright. She was scarcely prepared
for the passionate outburst of the child, who
suddenly flung forth eager hands with a cry
of surrender. Sylvia held the convulsed body
against her breast, tucking the distorted face
up under her chin. &#8220;There!&#8221; she soothed,
&#8220;there!&#8221; She carried her charge out of the
room without wasting words. She had observed
that when the child came to her the
man had seemed on the point of surrender,
too. With an effort he had kept himself inert,
with a wan face. He had the dubious, <i>sounding</i>
expression of one who stands at a door
with his back to the light and looks out into
the dark.</p>
<p>Before she had brought the child back,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
washed and comforted, to help her with her
food, Peterson had forgotten the interruption
entirely. Taking advantage of Sylvia&#8217;s absence
(as if she had been an interfering factor
in the meeting, but scarcely a third person),
he turned keen eyes upon Harboro. &#8220;Old
Harboro!&#8221; he said affectionately and musingly.
Then he seemed to be swelling up,
as if he were a mobile vessel filled with water
that had begun to boil. He became as red
as a victim of apoplexy. His eyes filled with
an unholy mirth, his teeth glistened. His
voice was a mere wheeze, issuing from a
cataclysm of agonized mirth.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>And so you&#8217;ve come to it at last!</i>&#8221; he managed
to articulate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to what?&#8221; inquired Harboro. His
level glance was disconcerting.</p>
<p>Peterson was on the defensive immediately.
&#8220;You used not to care for women&mdash;or you
claimed you didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! I didn&#8217;t understand. I used not to
care for&mdash;a certain class of women. I don&#8217;t
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threatened boiling-over process was
abruptly checked, as if a lid had been lifted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said Peterson weakly. He gazed at
a fragment of roast beef on his plate. It
might have been some sort of strange insect.
He frowned at it. And then his eyes
blazed steadily and brightly. He did not
look at Harboro again for a long time.</p>
<p>Sylvia came back, moving a little shyly,
and pushing a strand of hair back into its
place. She looked across the dining-room to
where the child was talking with old-fashioned
sedateness to her father. She had forgotten
her tragedy&mdash;for the moment. The man appeared
to have forgotten, too.</p>
<p>But Peterson&#8217;s dinner turned out to be a
failure, after all. Conversation became desultory,
listless.</p>
<p>They arose from their places at last and
left the room. On the street they stood for
a moment, but nothing was said about another
meeting. Harboro thought of inviting
Peterson over to the house; but he fancied
Sylvia wouldn&#8217;t like it; and besides, the
man&#8217;s grossness was there, more patent than
ever, and it stood between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, good-by,&#8221; said Peterson. He shook
hands with Harboro and with Sylvia. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
while he shook hands with Sylvia he was
looking at Harboro. All that was substantial
in the man&#8217;s nature was educed by men,
not by women; and he was fond of Harboro.
To him Sylvia was an incident, while Harboro
was an episode. Harboro typified work and
planning and the rebuffs of the day. Sylvia
meant to him only a passing pleasure and the
relaxation of the night or of a holiday.</p>
<p>As he went away he seemed eager to get
around a corner somewhere. He seemed to
be swelling up again. You might have supposed
he was about to explode.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER VIII</p>
</div>

<p>Sylvia&#8217;s dress made its appearance in due
course in the house on the Quemado Road.</p>
<p>Sylvia could not understand why Harboro
should have arranged to have it delivered according
to routine, paying the duty on it. It
seemed to her a waste of money, a willingness
to be a victim of extortion. Why should the
fact that the river was there make any difference?
It was some scheme of the merchants
of Eagle Pass, probably, the purpose of which
was to compel you to buy from them, and
pay higher prices, and take what you didn&#8217;t
want.</p>
<p>The dress was a wonderful affair: a triumph
of artful simplicity. It was white,
with a suggestion of warmth: an effect produced
by a second fabric underlying the visible
silk. It made Sylvia look like a gentle
queen of marionettes. A set of jewelry of
silver filigree had been bought to go with it:
circles of butterflies of infinite delicacy for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
bracelets, and a necklace. You would have
said there was only wanting a star to bind in
her hair and a wand for her to carry.</p>
<p>But the Mesquite Club ball came and
went, and the Harboros were not invited.</p>
<p>Harboro was stunned. The ball was on a
Friday night: and on Saturday he went up
to the balcony of his house with a copy of
the <i>Guide</i> clutched in his hand. He did not
turn to the railroad news. He was interested
only in the full-column, first-page account of
the ball at the Mesquite Club. There was
the customary amount of fine writing, including
a patent straining for new adjectives to
apply to familiar decorations. And then
there was a list of the names of the guests.
Possibly Piedras Negras hadn&#8217;t been included&mdash;and
possibly he was still regarded as belonging
to the railroad offices, and the people
across the river.</p>
<p>But no, there were the names: heads of
departments and the usual presentable clerks&mdash;young
Englishmen with an air. The General
Manager, as Harboro knew, was on a
trip to Torreon; but otherwise the list of
names was sufficient evidence that this first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
ball of the season had been a particularly
ambitious affair.</p>
<p>Sylvia was standing alone in the dining-room
while Harboro frowned darkly over the
list of names before him. The physical Sylvia
was in the dining-room; but her mind
was up on the balcony with Harboro. She
was watching him as he scowled at the first
page of the <i>Guide</i>. But if chagrin was the
essence of the thing that bothered Harboro,
something far deeper caused Sylvia to stand
like a slim, slumbering tree. She was frightened.
Harboro would begin to ask why?
And he was a man. He would guess the
reason. He would begin to realize that mere
obscurity on the part of his wife was not
enough to explain the fact that the town
refused to recognize her existence. And
then...?</p>
<p>Antonia spoke to her once and again without
being heard. Would the señora have the
roast put on the table now, or would she wait
until the señor came down-stairs? She decided
for herself, bringing in the roast with an
entirely erroneous belief that she was moving
briskly. An ancient Mexican woman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
knows very well what the early months of
marriage are. There is a flame, and then
there are ashes. Then the ashes must be
removed by mutual effort and embers are
discovered. Then life is good and may run
along without any annoyances.</p>
<p>When the señor went up-stairs with scarcely
a word to the señora, Antonia looked within,
seeming to notice nothing. But to herself
she was saying: &#8220;The time of ashes.&#8221; The
bustle of the domestic life was good at such
a time. She brought in the roast.</p>
<p>Harboro, with the keen senses of a healthy
man who is hungry, knew that the roast had
been placed on the table, but he did not stir.
The <i>Guide</i> had slipped from his knee to the
floor, and he was looking away to the darkening
tide of the Rio Grande. He had looked
at his problem from every angle, and now he
was coming to a conclusion which did him
credit.</p>
<p>... They had not been invited to the
ball. Well, what had he done that people
who formerly had gone out of their way to
be kind to him should ignore him? (It did
not occur to him for an instant that the cause
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
lay with Sylvia.) He was not a conceited
man, but ... an eligible bachelor must, certainly,
be regarded more interestedly than a
man with a wife, particularly in a community
where the young women were blooming and
eligible men were scarce. They had drawn
him into their circle because they had regarded
him as a desirable husband for one
of their young women. He remembered now
how the processes of the social mill had
brought him up before this young woman and
that until he had met them all: how, often,
he had found himself having a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with
some kindly disposed girl whom he never
would have thought of singling out for special
attention. He hadn&#8217;t played their game.
He might have remained a bachelor and all
would have been well. There would always
have been the chance of something happening.
But he had found a wife outside their circle.
He had, in effect, snubbed them before they
had snubbed him. He remembered now how
entirely absorbed he had been in his affair
with Sylvia, and how the entire community
had become a mere indistinct background
during those days when he walked with her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
and planned their future. There wasn&#8217;t any
occasion for him to feel offended. He had ignored
the town&mdash;and the town had paid him
back in his own coin.</p>
<p>He had conquered his black mood entirely
when Sylvia came up to him. She regarded
him a moment timidly, and then she put her
hand on his shoulder. He looked up at her
with the alert kindliness which she had learned
to prize.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re fearfully disappointed,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was. But I&#8217;m not now.&#8221; He told her
what his theory was, putting it into a few
detached words. But she understood and
brightened immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose that&#8217;s it?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What else could it be?&#8221; He arose.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t Antonia ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think so. And there are so many ways
for us to be happy without going to their silly
affairs. Imagine getting any pleasure out of
sitting around watching a girl trying to get
a man! That&#8217;s all they amount to, those
things. We&#8217;ll get horses and ride. It&#8217;s ever
so much more sensible.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>She felt like a culprit let out of prison as
she followed him down into the dining-room.
For the moment she was no longer the fatalist,
foreseeing inevitable exposure and punishment.
Nothing had come of their meeting
with Peterson&mdash;an incident which had taken
her wholly by surprise, and which had threatened
for an instant to result disastrously.
She had spent wakeful hours as a result of
that meeting; but the cloud of apprehension
had passed, leaving her sky serene again.
And now Harboro had put aside the incident
of the Mesquite Club ball as if it did not involve
anything more than a question of pique.</p>
<p>She took her place at the end of the table,
and propped her face up in her hands while
Harboro carved the roast. Why shouldn&#8217;t
she hope that the future was hers, to do with
as she would&mdash;or, at least, as she could?
That her fate now lay in her own hands, and
not in every passing wind of circumstance,
seemed possible, even probable. If only....</p>
<p>A name came into her mind suddenly; a
name carved in jagged, sinister characters.
If only Fectnor would stay away off there in
the City.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>She did not know why that name should
have occurred to her just now to plague her.
Fectnor was an evil bird of passage who had
come and gone. Such creatures had no fixed
course. He had once told her that only a
fool ever came back the way he had gone.
He belonged to the States, somewhere, but
he would come back by way of El Paso, if
he ever came back; or he would drift over
toward Vera Cruz or Tampico.</p>
<p>Fectnor was one of those who had trod
that path through the mesquite to Sylvia&#8217;s
back door in the days which were ended.
But he was different from the others. He
was a man who was lavish with money&mdash;but
he expected you to pick it up out of the dust.
He was of violent moods; and he had that
audacity&mdash;that taint of insanity, perhaps&mdash;which
enables some men to maintain the
reputation of bad men, of &#8220;killers,&#8221; in every
frontier. When Fectnor had come he had
seemed to assume the right of prior possession,
and others had yielded to him without question.
Indeed, it was usually known when the
man was in town, and during these periods
none came to Sylvia&#8217;s door save one. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
even created the impression that all others
were poachers, and that they had better be
wary of him. She had been afraid of him
from the first; and it had seemed to her that
her only cross was removed when she heard
that Fectnor had got a contract down in the
interior and had gone away. That had happened
a good many months ago; and Sylvia
remembered now, with a feeling as of an icy
hand on her heart, that if her relationships
with many of the others in those old days
were innocent enough&mdash;or at best marred only
by a kindly folly&mdash;there had been that in her
encounters with Fectnor which would forever
damn her in Harboro&#8217;s eyes, if the truth ever
reached him. He would have the right to
call her a bad woman; and if the word seemed
fantastic and unreal to her, she knew that it
would not seem so to Harboro.</p>
<p>If only Fectnor....</p>
<p>She winked quickly two or three times, as
if she had been dreaming. Antonia had set
her plate before her, and the aroma of the
roast was in her nostrils. Harboro was regarding
her serenely, affectionately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER IX</p>
</div>

<p>They were happier than ever, following
that adjusting episode.</p>
<p>Harboro felt that his place had been assigned
to him, and he was satisfied. He
would have to think of ways of affording
diversion for Sylvia, of course; but that could
be managed, and in the meantime she seemed
disposed to prolong the rapturous and sufficient
joys of their honeymoon. He would be
on the lookout, and when the moment of reaction
came he would be ready with suggestions.
She had spoken of riding. There
would be places to go. The <i>bailes</i> out at the
Quemado; weddings far out in the chaparral.
Many Americans attended these affairs in a
spirit of adventure, and the ride was always
delightful. There was a seduction in the
desert winds, in the low-vaulted skies with
their decorative schemes of constellations.</p>
<p>He was rather at a loss as to how to meet
the people who had made a fellow of him.
There was Dunwoodie, for example. He ran
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
into Dunwoodie one morning on his way to
work, and the good fellow had stopped him
with an almost too patent friendliness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, stop long enough to have a drink,&#8221;
said Dunwoodie, blushing without apparent
cause and shaking Harboro awkwardly by
the hand. And then, as if this blunt invitation
might prove too transparent, he added:
&#8220;I was in a game last night, and I&#8217;m needing
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no need for Dunwoodie to explain
his desire for a drink&mdash;or his disinclination
to drink alone. Harboro saw nothing
out of the ordinary in the invitation; but
unfortunately he responded before he had
quite taken the situation into account.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty early for me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Another
time&mdash;if you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was to be regretted that Harboro&#8217;s manner
seemed a trifle stiff; and Dunwoodie read
uncomfortable meanings into that refusal.
He never repeated the invitation; and others,
hearing of the incident, concluded that Harboro
was too deeply offended by what the
town had done to him to care for anybody&#8217;s
friendship any more. The thing that the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
town had done to Harboro was like an open
page to everybody. Indeed, the people of
Eagle Pass knew that Harboro had been
counted out of eligible circles considerably
before Harboro knew it himself.</p>
<p>As for Sylvia, contentment overspread her
like incense. She was to have Harboro all
to herself, and she was not to be required to
run the gantlet of the town&#8217;s too-knowing
eyes. She felt safe in that house on the
Quemado Road, and she hoped that she now
need not emerge from it until old menaces
were passed, and people had come and gone,
and she could begin a new chapter.</p>
<p>She was somewhat annoyed by her father
during those days. He sent messages by
Antonia. Why didn&#8217;t she come to see him?
She was happy, yes. But could she forget
her old father? Was she that kind of a
daughter? Such was the substance of the
messages which reached her.</p>
<p>She would not go to see him. She could
not bear to think of entering his house. She
had been homesick occasionally&mdash;that she
could not deny. There had been moments
when the new home oppressed her by its orderliness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
by its strangeness. And she was
fond of her father. She supposed she ought
not to be fond of him; he had always been a
worthless creature. But such matters have
little to do with the law of cause and effect.
She loved him&mdash;there was the truth, and it
could not be ignored. But with every passing
day the house under the mesquite-tree
assumed a more terrible aspect in her eyes,
and the house on the Quemado Road became
more familiar, dearer.</p>
<p>Unknown to Harboro, she sent money to
her father. He had intimated that if she
could not come there were certain needs ...
there was no work to be obtained, seemingly....
And so the money which she might
have used for her own pleasure went to her
father. She was not unscrupulous in this
matter. She did not deceive Harboro. She
merely gave to her father the money which
Harboro gave her, and which she was expected
to use without explaining how it was
spent.</p>
<p>With the passing of days she ceased to
worry about those messages of her father&mdash;she
ceased to regard them as reminders that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
the tie between her old life and the new was
not entirely broken. And following the increased
assurances of her safety in Harboro&#8217;s
house and heart, she began to give rein to
some of the coquetries of her nature.</p>
<p>She became an innocent siren, studying
ways of bewitchment, of endearment. She
became a bewildering revelation to him,
amazing him, delighting him. After he had
begun to conclude that he knew her she became
not one woman, but a score of women:
demure, elfin, pensive, childlike, sedate, aloof,
laughing&mdash;but always with her delight in him
unconcealed: the mask she wore always
slipping from its place to reveal her eagerness
to draw closer to him, and always closer.</p>
<p>The evenings were beginning to be cool,
and occasionally she enticed him after nightfall
into the room he had called her boudoir.
She drew the blinds and played the infinitely
varied game of love with him. She asked
him to name some splendid lover, some famous
courtier. Ingomar? Very well, he should be
Ingomar. What sort of lover was he?...
And forthwith her words, her gestures and
touches became as chains of flowers to lead
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
him to do her bidding. Napoleon? She saluted
him, and marched prettily before him&mdash;and
halted to claim her reward in kisses.
He was Antony and Leander.</p>
<p>When she climbed on his knees with kisses
for Leander he pretended to be surprised.
&#8220;More kisses?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;But these are the first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And those other kisses?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They? Oh, they were for Antony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but if you have kissed Antony, Leander
does not want your kisses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face seemed to fade slightly, as if certain
lights had been extinguished. She withdrew
a little from him and did not look at
him. &#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked presently. The
gladness had gone out of her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well ... kisses should be for one lover;
not for two.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pondered, and turned to him with an
air of triumph. &#8220;But you see, these are
new kisses for Leander. They are entirely
different. They&#8217;ve never been given before.
They&#8217;ve got nothing to do with the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pretended to be convinced. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
kisses she gave to Leander were less rapturous.
She was thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you don&#8217;t think so highly
of ... Leander,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;Suppose
I be ... Samson?&#8221;</p>
<p>She leaned her head on his shoulder as if
she had grown tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Samson was a very strong man,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;He could push a house down.&#8221;</p>
<p>That interested her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to be Samson?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it might be nice ... but no&mdash;the
woman who kissed Samson betrayed him.
I think I won&#8217;t be Samson, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had been nervously fingering the necklace
of gold beads at her throat; and suddenly
she uttered a distressed cry. The string had
broken, and the beads fell in a yellow shower
to the rug.</p>
<p>She climbed down on her knees beside him
and picked up the beads, one by one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them go,&#8221; he urged cheerfully, noting
her distress. &#8220;Come back. I&#8217;ll be anybody
you choose. Even Samson.&#8221;</p>
<p>That extinguished light seemed to have
been turned on again. She looked up at him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
smiling. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t want you to be Samson,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t want to lose
my beads.&#8221;</p>
<p>He regarded her happily. She looked very
little and soft there on the rug. &#8220;You look
like a kitten,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>She picked up the last bead and looked at
the unstable baubles in her pink left palm.
She tilted her hand so that they rolled back
and forth. &#8220;Could a kitten look at a king?&#8221;
she asked with mock earnestness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it could, if there happened
to be any king about.&#8221;</p>
<p>She continued to make the beads roll about
on her hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a kitten,&#8221;
she declared with decision. &#8220;Would you like
me to be a kitten?&#8221; She raised herself on
her knees and propped her right hand behind
her on the rug for support. She was looking
earnestly into his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d like to be,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your hand,&#8221; she commanded. She
poured the beads into his immense, hard
palm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t spill them.&#8221; She turned
about on the rug on hands and knees, and
crept away to the middle of the floor. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
turned and arose to her knees, and rested both
hands before her on the floor. She held her
head high and <i>meowed</i> twice so realistically
that Harboro leaned forward, regarding her
with wonder. She lowered herself and turned
and crept to the window. There she lifted
herself a little and patted the tassel which
hung from the blind. She continued this with
a certain sedateness and concentration until
the tassel went beyond her reach and caught
in the curtain. Then she let herself down
again, and crawled to the middle of the floor.
Now she was on her knees, her hands on the
floor before her, her body as erect as she could
hold it. Again she <i>meowed</i>&mdash;this time with
a certain ennui; and finally she raised one
arm and rubbed it slowly to and fro behind
her ear.... She quickly assumed a defensive
attitude, crouching fiercely. An imaginary
dog had crossed her path. She made
an explosive sound with her lips. She regained
her tranquillity, staring with slowly
returning complacency and contempt while
the imaginary dog disappeared.</p>
<p>Harboro did not speak. He looked on in
amazed silence to see what she would do next.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
His swarthy face was too sphinx-like to express
pleasure, yet he was not displeased.
He was thinking: She is a child&mdash;but what
an extraordinary child!</p>
<p>She crawled toward him and leaned against
his leg. <i>She was purring!</i></p>
<p>Harboro stooped low to see how she did it,
but her hair hid her lips from him.</p>
<p>He seized her beneath the arms and lifted
her until her face was on a level with his.
He regarded her almost uncomfortably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you like me to be a kitten?&#8221; She
adjusted her knees on his lap and rested her
hands on his shoulders. She regarded him
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well ... a kitten gets to be a cat,&#8221; he
suggested.</p>
<p>She pulled one end of his long mustache,
regarding him intently. &#8220;Oh, a cat. But
this is a different kind of a kitten entirely.
It&#8217;s got nothing to do with cats.&#8221; She held
her head on one side and pulled his mustache
slowly through her fingers. &#8220;It won&#8217;t curl,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not the curly sort of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>She considered that. It seemed to present
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
an idea that was new to her. &#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m
glad you&#8217;re a big fellow.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he did not respond to this, she went on:
&#8220;Those little shrimps&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t be a
kitten with them. They would have to be
puppies. That&#8217;s the only fun you could
have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sylvia!&#8221; he remonstrated. He adjusted
her so that she sat on his lap, with her face
against his throat. He was recalling that
other Sylvia: the Sylvia of the dining-room,
of the balcony; the circumspect, sensible,
comprehending Sylvia. But the discoveries
he was making were not unwelcome. Folly
wore for him a face of ecstasy, of beauty.</p>
<p>As she nestled against him, he whispered:
&#8220;Is the sandman coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>And she responded, with her lips against
his throat: &#8220;Yes&mdash;if you&#8217;ll carry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Antonia was wrong. This was not the
time of ashes. It was the time of flame.

<p>CHAPTER X</p>
</div>

<p>And then Fectnor came.</p>
<p>The date of the election was drawing near,
and a new sheriff was to be jockeyed into
office by the traditional practice of corralling
all the male adult Mexicans who could be
reached, and making them vote just so. The
voice of the people was about to be heard in
the land.</p>
<p>It was a game which enjoyed the greatest
popularity along the border in those years.
Two played at it: the opposing candidates.
And each built him a corral and began capturing
Mexicans two or three days before
the election.</p>
<p>The Mexicans were supposed to have their
abodes (of a sort) in Maverick County; but
there was nothing conservative in the rules
under which the game was played. If you
could get a consignment of voters from
Mexico you might do so, resting assured that
your opponent would not hesitate to fill his
corral with citizens from the other side of the
river.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>The corrals were amazing places. Dispensers
of creature comforts were engaged.
Barbecued meat and double rations of <i>mezcal</i>
were provided. Your Mexican voters, held
rigorously as prisoners, were in a state of collapse
before the day of the election. They
were conveyed in carryalls to the polls, and
heads were counted, and the candidate got
credit for the full number of constituents he
had dumped out into the sunshine.</p>
<p>And then your voter disappeared back into
the chaparral, or over the Rio Grande bridge,
and pondered over the insanity of the <i>gringos</i>.</p>
<p>It will be seen that the process touched
upon was less pleasant than simple. Among
the constituents in the corrals there was often
a tendency to fight, and occasionally a stubborn
fellow had a clear idea that he wanted
to be in a different corral from the one in
which he found himself. There was needed
a strong-handed henchman in these cases.
Jesus Mendoza was the henchman for one
faction, but the other faction needed a henchman,
too.</p>
<p>And so Fectnor came.</p>
<p>He had the reputation of knowing every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
Mexican in Maverick County and in the
territory immediately contiguous thereto.
Many of them had been members of his
gangs when he had contracts in the neighborhood
of Eagle Pass. He knew precisely which
of them could be depended upon to remain
docile under all manner of indignity, and
which of them had a bad habit of placing a
sudden check on their laughter and lunging
forward with a knife. They knew him, too.
They feared him. They knew he could be
coldly brutal&mdash;an art which no Mexican has
ever mastered. The politicians knew that
getting Fectnor was almost equivalent to getting
the office. It was more economical to
pay him his price than to employ uncertain
aids who would have sold their services much
more cheaply.</p>
<p>Harboro and Sylvia were sitting on their
balcony the second night before the election.
A warm wind had been blowing and it was
quite pleasant out of doors.</p>
<p>One of the corrals lay not far from the
house on the Quemado Road. Mounted Mexicans
had been riding past the house and on
into the town all day, and, contrary to usual
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
custom, they were not to be seen later in the
day returning to the chaparral. They were
being prepared to exercise their suffrage privileges.</p>
<p>As Harboro and Sylvia listened it was to
be noted that over in the corral the several
noises were beginning to be blended in one
note. The barbecue fires were burning down;
the evening meal had been served, with reserved
supplies for late comers. <i>Mezcal</i> and
cheap whiskey were being dispensed. A low
hum of voices arose, with the occasional uplifting
of a drunken song or a shout of anger.</p>
<p>Suddenly Harboro sat more erect. A shout
had arisen over in the corral, and a murmur
higher and more sinister than the dominant
note of the place grew steadily in intensity.
It came to a full stop when a pistol-shot arose
above the lesser noises like a sky-rocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting his work in,&#8221; commented
Harboro. He spoke to himself. He had forgotten
Sylvia for the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;He? Who?&#8221; inquired Sylvia.</p>
<p>He turned toward her in the dusk and replied&mdash;with
indifference in his tone now&mdash;&#8220;Fectnor.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>She shrank back so that her face would be
out of his line of vision. &#8220;Fectnor!&#8221; she
echoed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fellow they&#8217;ve brought up from the interior
to help with the election. A famous
bad man, I believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was silence for a long interval. Harboro
supposed the matter did not interest
her; but she asked at length: &#8220;You know
him, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only by reputation. A fellow with a lot
of bluff, I think. I don&#8217;t believe very much
in bad men. He&#8217;s managed to terrify the
Mexicans somehow or other.&#8221; He had not
noticed that her voice had become dull and
low.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fectnor!&#8221; she breathed to herself. She
rocked to and fro, and after a long interval,
&#8220;Fectnor!&#8221; she repeated.</p>
<p>He hitched his chair so that he could look
at her. Her prolonged silence was unusual.
&#8220;Are you getting chilly?&#8221; he asked solicitously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem chilly, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she responded.</p>
<p>They arose and went into the house.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XI</p>
</div>

<p>Antonia went marketing the next morning,
and when she came back Sylvia met her
with fearful, inquiring eyes. She was terribly
uneasy, and she was one of those creatures
who must go more than half-way to
meet impending danger. She was not at all
surprised when Antonia handed her a sealed
envelope.</p>
<p>The old servant did not linger to witness
the reading of that written message. She
possessed the discretion of her race, of her
age. The señora had been married quite
a time now. Doubtless there were old
friends....</p>
<p>And Sylvia stood alone, reading the sprawling
lines which her father had written:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Fectnor&#8217;s here. He wants to see you. Better
come down to the house. You know he&#8217;s likely
to make trouble if he doesn&#8217;t have his way.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>She spelled out the words with contracted
brows; and then for the moment she became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
still another Sylvia. She tore the missive
into bits. She was pale with rage&mdash;rage
which was none the less obsessing because it
had in it the element of terror. Her father
dared to suggest such a thing! It would
have been bad enough if Fectnor had sent
the summons himself; but for her father to
unite with him against her in such an affair!</p>
<p>She tried to calm herself, succeeding but
illy. &#8220;Antonia!&#8221; she called. &#8220;Antonia!&#8221;
For once her voice was unlovely, her expression
was harsh.</p>
<p>The startled old woman came with quite
unprecedented alacrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Antonia, where did you see my father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the street. He seemed to have waited
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well. You must find him again.
It doesn&#8217;t matter how long you search. I
want you to find him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hurriedly framed a response to that
note of her father&#8217;s:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I will not come. Tell Fectnor I never will
see him again. He will not dare to harm me.</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>As she placed this cry of defiance into an
envelope and sealed and addressed it certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
words of Harboro&#8217;s came back to her. That
night of their wedding he had lifted her in
his powerful arms and had given her a man&#8217;s
assurance: &#8220;I mean that you&#8217;re to have all
the help you want&mdash;that you&#8217;re to look to
me for your strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>She reasoned shrewdly: Harboro wasn&#8217;t
the sort of man people would tell things to&mdash;about
her. They would know what to expect:
intense passion, swift punishment.</p>
<p>And yet as she watched Antonia go away
down the road, suggesting supine submission
rather than a friend in need, her heart failed
her. Had she done wisely? Fectnor had
never stepped aside for any man. He seemed
actually to believe that none must deny him
the things he wanted. He seemed an insane
creature when you thwarted him. There was
something terrible about his rages.</p>
<p>She imagined seemingly impossible things:
that Fectnor would come to the house&mdash;perhaps
while Harboro was there. He might kill
Harboro.</p>
<p>Alas, the evil she had done in those other
days loomed before her now in its true light:
not merely as evil deeds, definitely ended
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
with their commission, but as fearful forces
that went on existing, to visit her again and
destroy her.</p>
<p>She began to hope that Fectnor would
actually come to her&mdash;now, before Harboro
came home. At the worst she might save
Harboro, and there was even a chance that
she could make Fectnor see her position as
she saw it&mdash;that she could persuade him to
be merciful to her. Surely for the sake of
security and peace in all the years that lay
before her.... A definite purpose dawned
in her eyes. She went to her room and began
deliberately to choose her most becoming
street costume.</p>
<p>She was ready to go out when Antonia returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you find him?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Yes, the old woman had found him and delivered
the message. He had sent no word
in return; he had only glared at the bearer of
the message and had cursed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; said Sylvia soothingly.
It occurred to her that it must be a sad thing
to be an old woman, and a Mexican, and to
have to serve as the wire over which the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
electric current flowed&mdash;and to feel only the
violence of the current without comprehending
the words it carried.</p>
<p>And now to find Fectnor&mdash;for this was what
she meant to do.</p>
<p>She would see him on the street, where
publicity would protect her, even if there
were no friends to take her part. She would
see him on the street and explain why she
could not meet him any more, why he must
not ask it. Certainly it would not look very
well for her to be seen talking to him; but
she could not help that. She would be going
out to do a little shopping, ostensibly, and
she would hope to encounter him on the street,
either coming or going.</p>
<p>However, her earnest planning proved to
be of no avail. Fectnor was nowhere to be
seen.</p>
<p>She walked rather leisurely through the
town&mdash;moving barely fast enough to avoid
the appearance of loitering. She walked circumspectly
enough, seemingly taking little
interest in events or individuals. That she
was keenly on the alert for one familiar face
no one would have guessed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>She got quite to the end of the main street,
and then she halted in painful uncertainty.
If she turned back now she would have to
go on steadily back to her home, save for a
brief stop at one of the stores, or else betray
the fact to any who might be curiously observing
her that she was on the street on
some secret mission.</p>
<p>She stood for a space, trying to decide what
to do. Often before she had stood on that
very spot to view the picture which men and
the desert had painted on a vast canvas down
toward the river. She occupied a point of
vantage at the top of a long flight of stone
steps, broken and ancient, leading down to
the Rio Grande and its basin. Along the
water&#8217;s edge in the distance, down in the
depths below her, ancient Mexican women
were washing garments by a process which
must have been old in Pharaoh&#8217;s time: by
spreading them on clean rocks and kneading
them or applying brushes. The river flowed
placidly; the sunlight enveloped water and
rock and shore and the patient women bending
over their tasks. Nineveh or Tyre might
have presented just such a picture of burdened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
women, concealing no one might say what
passions and fires under an exterior which
suggested docility or the unkind pressure of
tradition&#8217;s hand or even hopelessness.</p>
<p>But Sylvia scarcely saw the picture now.
She was recalling the words she had written
in that message to her father. If only she
had not defied Fectnor; if only she had made
a plea for pity, or suggested a fear of her
husband&mdash;or if she hadn&#8217;t sent any answer
at all!</p>
<p>It occurred to her that the exposure which
menaced her was as nothing to the perils to
which she had subjected Harboro. She knew
instinctively that Harboro was not a man to
submit to deliberate injury from any source.
He would defend himself in the face of any
danger; he would defend that which belonged
to him. And Fectnor was cruel and unscrupulous
and cunning. He knew how to provoke
quarrels and to gain advantages.</p>
<p>She grew cold at the thought of losing Harboro.
The inevitable consequences of such a
loss occurred to her. She would have to submit
always to Fectnor as long as he willed it.
And afterward.... Ah, she must find Fectnor!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>She retraced her steps. At a shop where
silks were sold she entered. She asked for a
piece of ribbon. A particular shade of blue;
she could not describe it. She sat on a stool
at the counter and kept an eye on the street....
No, something darker than that, something
less lustrous. She examined bolt after
bolt, and when at length it appeared that she
was quite unwilling to be pleased she made
a choice. And always she watched the street,
hoping that Fectnor would pass.</p>
<p>At last she went up the Quemado Road,
walking disconsolately. The withered immensity
of the world broke her spirit. The
vast stricken spaces were but a material manifestation
of those cruelties of nature which
had broken her long ago, and which could not
be expected to withdraw their spell now that
the time had come for her destruction.</p>
<p>She looked far before her and saw where
the Quemado Road attained its highest point
and disappeared on the other side of a ridge.
A house stood there, lonely and serene. She
had known it was a convent; but now she
observed it with eyes which really saw it for
the first time. It had looked cool even during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
the period of midsummer. There was
shade&mdash;a friendly garden. She had seen the
Mother Superior once or twice: a large, elderly
woman who wore but lightly the sedate mien
which concealed a gentle humanity.</p>
<p>What if she, Sylvia, were to go on past
her own house, on up to the ridge, and appeal
to that unworldly woman for succor?
Was there a refuge there for such as she?</p>
<p>But this was the merest passing fancy.
Where the tides of life ran high she had been
moulded; here in the open she would meet
her end, whatever the end might be.</p>
<p>She sat inside her house throughout that
long day. Beside an open window she kept
her place, staring toward Eagle Pass, her eyes
widening whenever a figure appeared on the
highway.</p>
<p>But the individual she feared&mdash;Fectnor,
her father, a furtive messenger&mdash;did not appear.</p>
<p>Harboro came at last: Harboro, bringing
power and placidity.</p>
<p>She ran out to the gate to meet him. Inside
the house she flung herself into his arms.</p>
<p>He marvelled at her intensity. He held
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
her a long moment in his embrace. Then he
gazed into her eyes searchingly. &#8220;Everything
is all right,&#8221; he said&mdash;the words being
an affirmation rather than a question. He
had read an expression of dread in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, everything is all right,&#8221; she echoed.
Everything <i>was</i> right now. She seemed to
awaken from a horrible nightmare. Harboro&#8217;s
presence put to flight an army of fears.
She could scarcely understand why she had
been so greatly disturbed. No harm could
come to him, or to her. He was too strong,
too self-contained, to be menaced by little
creatures. The bigness of him, the penetrating,
kindly candor of his eyes, would paralyze
base minds and violent hands seeking
to do him an injury. The law had sanctioned
their union, too&mdash;and the law was powerful.</p>
<p>She held to that supporting thought, and
during the rest of the evening she was untroubled
by the instinctive knowledge that
even the law cannot make right what the individual
has made wrong.</p>
<p>She was as light-hearted as a child that
night, and Harboro, after the irksome restraints
of the day, rejoiced in her. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
played at the game of love again; and old
Antonia, in her place down-stairs, thought of
that exchange of letters and darkly pondered.

<p>CHAPTER XII</p>
</div>

<p>The election came and went; the voice of
the people had been heard, and Maverick
County had a new sheriff. In the house on
the Quemado Road Fectnor&#8217;s name was heard
no more.</p>
<p>On the Saturday night following the election
Harboro came home and found a letter
waiting for him on the table in the hall. He
found also a disquieted Sylvia, who looked at
him with brooding and a question in her eyes.</p>
<p>He stopped where he stood and read the
letter, and Sylvia watched with parted lips&mdash;for
she had recognized the handwriting on the
envelope.</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s brows lowered into a frown.
&#8220;It&#8217;s from your father,&#8221; he said finally, lifting
his eyes from the letter and regarding
Sylvia.</p>
<p>She tried to achieve an effect of only mild
interest. &#8220;What can he have to write to
you about?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellow&mdash;it seems he&#8217;s been ill. Sylvia,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
how long has it been since you visited
your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he want me to come to see him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hints at that pretty strongly. Yes,
that&#8217;s really the substance of his letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been back since we were married.&#8221;</p>
<p>She led the way into the dining-room. Her
manner was not quite responsive. She made
Harboro feel that this was a matter which
did not concern him.</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t that&mdash;doesn&#8217;t that seem rather
neglectful?&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew a chair away from the table and
sat down facing him. &#8220;Yes, it does seem so.
I think I&#8217;ve hinted that I wasn&#8217;t happy in
my old home life; but I&#8217;ve never talked very
much about it. I ought to tell you, I think,
that I want to forget all about it. I want the
old relationship broken off completely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro shook his head with decision.
&#8220;That won&#8217;t do,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Believe me,
you&#8217;re making a mistake. You&#8217;re a good deal
younger than I, Sylvia, and it&#8217;s the way of
the young to believe that for every old tie
broken a new one can be formed. At your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
age life seems to have an abundance of everything.
But you&#8217;ll be dismayed, in a few
years, to discover that most things come to
us but once, and that nearly all the best
things come to us in our youth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood before her with an air of such
quiet conviction, of such tranquil certainty
of the truth of what he said that she could not
meet his glance. She had placed an elbow
on the table, and was supporting her face in
her hand. Her expression was strangely inscrutable
to the man who looked down at
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father must be getting old. If you
shouldn&#8217;t see him for a year or so, you&#8217;d be
fearfully grieved to note the evidences of
failure: a slight stoop, perhaps; a slower
gait; a more troubled look in his eyes. I
want to help you to see this thing clearly.
And some day you&#8217;ll get word that he is dead&mdash;and
then you&#8217;ll remember, too late, how
you might have carried little joys to him,
how you might have been a better daughter....&#8221;</p>
<p>She sprang up, shaking the tears from her
eyes. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go,&#8221; she said. She startled Harboro
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
by that note of despair in her voice.
&#8220;When does he wish me to come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he is ill and alone. I think he
would be glad if I could persuade you to go
this evening. Why not this evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Harboro concealed a part of
the truth in this. Her father had quite definitely
asked to have her come this evening.
But Harboro wished her to feel that she was
acting voluntarily, that she was choosing for
herself, both as to the deed and as to the
time of its doing.</p>
<p>And Sylvia felt a wave of relief at the assurance
that her father had not set a definite
time. Oh, surely the letter was just what it
purported to be&mdash;a cry of loneliness and an
honest desire to see her. And Sylvia really
loved her father. There was that in her nature
which made it impossible for her to
judge him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could go with you,&#8221; ventured Harboro,
&#8220;though he doesn&#8217;t say anything about my
coming. I&#8217;ve felt we must both go soon.
Of course, I need not wait for an invitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sylvia opposed this. &#8220;If he&#8217;s ill,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
she said, &#8220;I think I ought to go alone this
time.&#8221; She added to herself: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
him ever to go. I must make him believe
that enough has been done if I go myself.
I must convince him that my father doesn&#8217;t
care to have him come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she was quite resigned to the
arrangement that had been made for her.
She helped Antonia make the final preparations
for supper, and she set off down the road
quite cheerfully after they arose from the
table. Harboro watched her with a new depth
of tenderness. This sweet submission, the
quick recognition of a filial duty once it was
pointed out to her&mdash;here were qualities which
were of the essence of that childlike beauty
which is the highest charm in women.</p>
<p>And Sylvia felt a strange eagerness of body
and mind as she went on her way. She had
put all thought of the house under the mesquite-tree
out of mind, as far as possible.
Becoming a closed book to her, the place and
certain things which had been dear to her
had become indistinct in her memory. Now
that she was about to reopen the book various
little familiar things came back to her and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
filled her mind with eagerness. The tiny
canary in its cage&mdash;it would remember her.
It would wish to take a bath, to win her
praise. There had been a few potted plants,
too; and there would be the familiar pictures&mdash;even
the furniture she had known from
childhood would have eloquent messages for
her.</p>
<p>This was the frame of mind she was in as
she opened her father&#8217;s gate, and paused for
an instant to recall the fact that here she
had stood when Harboro appeared before her
for the first time. It was near sundown now,
just as it had been then; and&mdash;yes, the goatherd
was there away out on the trail, driving
his flock home.</p>
<p>She turned toward the house; she opened
the door eagerly. Her eyes were beaming
with happiness.</p>
<p>But she was chilled a little by the sight of
her father. Something Harboro had said
about her father changing came back to her.
He <i>had</i> changed&mdash;just in the little while that
had elapsed since her marriage. But the
realization of what that change was hurt her
cruelly. He looked mean and base as he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
never looked before. The old amiable submission
to adversities had given place to an
expression of petulance, of resentment, of
cunning, of cowardice. Or was it that Sylvia
was looking at him with new eyes?</p>
<p>He sat just inside the door, by a window.
He was in a rocking-chair, and his hands lay
heavily against the back of it. He had a
blanket about him, as if he were cold. He
looked at her with a strange lack of responsiveness
when she entered the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got your message,&#8221; she said affectionately.
&#8220;I am glad you let me know you
weren&#8217;t feeling very well.&#8221; She touched his
cheeks with her hands and kissed him. &#8220;You
<i>are</i> cold,&#8221; she added, as if she were answering
the question that had occurred to her at sight
of the blanket.</p>
<p>She sat down near him, waiting for him to
speak. He would have a great many things
to say to her, she thought. But he regarded
her almost stolidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your marriage seems to have changed
you,&#8221; he said finally.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the better, I hope!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s according to the way you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
look at it. Cutting your old father cold isn&#8217;t
for the better, as far as I can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not resent the ungenerous use of
that phrase, &#8220;old father,&#8221; though she could
not help remembering that he was still under
fifty, and that he looked young for his years.
It was just one of his mannerisms in speaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t do that, you know,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Being married seems a wonderful adventure.
There is so much that is strange for you to
get used to. But I didn&#8217;t forget you. You&#8217;ve
seen Antonia&mdash;occasionally...?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man moved his head so that it lay on
one side against the chair-back. &#8220;I thought
you&#8217;d throw that up to me,&#8221; he complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father!&#8221; she remonstrated. She was
deeply wounded. It had not been her father&#8217;s
way to make baseless, unjust charges against
her. Shiftless and blind he had been; but
there had been a geniality about him which
had softened his faults to one who loved him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; he said, in a less bitter
tone. And she waited, hoping he would think
of friendlier words to speak, now that his resentment
had been voiced.</p>
<p>But he seemed ill at ease in her presence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
now. She might have been a stranger to
him. She looked about her with a certain
fond expression which speedily faded. Somehow
the old things reminded her only of unhappiness.
They were meaner than she had
supposed them to be. Their influence over
her was gone.</p>
<p>She brought her gaze back to her father.
He had closed his eyes as if he were weary;
yet she discerned in the lines of his face a
hard fixity which troubled her, alarmed her.
Though his eyes were closed he did not present
a reposeful aspect. There was something
really sinister about that alert face with
its closed eyes&mdash;as there is about a house with
its blinds drawn to hide evil enterprises.</p>
<p>So she sat for interminable minutes, and it
seemed to Sylvia that she was not surprised
when she heard the sound of tapping at the
back door.</p>
<p>She was not surprised, yet a feeling of engulfing
horror came over her at the sound.</p>
<p>Her father opened his eyes now; and it
seemed really that he had been resting. &#8220;The
boy from the drug-store,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They
were to send me some medicine.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>He seemed to be gathering his energies to
get up and admit the boy from the drug-store,
but Sylvia sprang to her feet and placed a restraining
hand on his shoulder. &#8220;Let me go,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>There was an expression of pity and concern
for her father in her eyes when she got
to the door and laid her hand on the latch.
She was too absent-minded to observe at
first that the bolt had been moved into its
place, and that the door was locked. Her
hand had become strange to the mechanism
before her, and she was a little awkward in
getting the bolt out of the way. But the expression
of pity and concern was still in her
eyes when she finally pulled the door toward
her.</p>
<p>And then she seemed to have known all the
time that it was Fectnor who stood there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XIII</p>
</div>

<p>He slipped past her into the room, and when
she uttered a forlorn cry of defeat and shrank
back he gripped her by the wrist. Holding
her so, he turned where he stood and locked
the door again. Then he crossed the room,
and closed and bolted that other door which
opened into the room where Sylvia&#8217;s father sat.</p>
<p>Then he released her and stood his ground
stolidly while she shrank away from him,
regarding him with incredulous questioning,
with black terror. She got the impression
that he believed himself to have achieved a
victory; that there was no further occasion
for him to feel anxious or wary. It was as if
the disagreeable beginning to a profitable enterprise
had been gotten over with. And that
look of callous complacence was scarcely more
terrifying than his silence, for as yet he had
not uttered a word.</p>
<p>And yet Sylvia could not regard herself as
being really helpless. That door into her
father&#8217;s room: while it held, her father could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
not come to her, but she could go to her father.
She had only to wait until Fectnor was off his
guard, and touch the bolt and make her
escape. Yet she perceived now, that for all
Fectnor&#8217;s seeming complacence, he remained
between her and that door.</p>
<p>She looked about for other means of escape;
but she knew immediately that there was
none. Her own bedroom opened off the room
in which she was now trapped; but it was a
mere cubby-hole without an outer door or
even a window. On the other side of the
room there was a window looking out toward
the desert; but even as her glance sought
relief in that direction she remembered that
this window, of only half-sash dimensions,
was nailed into its place and was immovable.
Against the dusty panes a bird-cage hung,
and she realized with an oddly ill-timed pang
of sorrow that it was empty. It was plain
that the canary had died during her absence;
and she wondered if anything in all the world
could seem so empty as a bird-cage which had
once had an occupant and had lost it. The
sunset sky beyond that empty cage and the
uncleaned window-panes caught her glance:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
an infinitely far-off drift of saffron with never
a moving figure between it and the window
through which she looked.</p>
<p>Then all her terrors were renewed by Fectnor&#8217;s
voice. He had sauntered to a small
table near the middle of the room and sat
down on the end of it, after shoving a chair
in Sylvia&#8217;s direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Sylvia?&#8221; he
demanded. He scarcely seemed angry: impatient
would be the word, perhaps.</p>
<p>Something in his manner, rather than his
words, wiped out that chasm of time that
had been placed between them. It was as
if she had talked with him yesterday. She
felt hideously familiar with him&mdash;on the same
mental and moral plane with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am married,&#8221; she said shortly. If she
had thought she would resort to parleying
and evasions, she now had no intention of
doing so. It seemed inevitable that she
should talk to Fectnor in his own language.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care anything about your marriage,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;A bit of church flummery.
Use your brains, Sylvia. You know that
couldn&#8217;t make any difference.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about the flummery.
That isn&#8217;t it. It&#8217;s the fact that I love the
man I married.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All very well and good. But you know
you used to love me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes you did. You just forget. At
any rate, you was as much to me as you could
ever be to a husband. You know you can&#8217;t
drop me just because it&#8217;s convenient for you
to take up with somebody else. You know
that&#8217;s not the way I&#8217;m built.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had refused to use the chair he had
shoved toward her. She stood beside it a
little defiantly. Now she looked into his
eyes with a kind of imperious reasonableness.
&#8220;Whatever I was to you, Fectnor,&#8221; she said,
&#8220;I became because I was forced into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never forced you,&#8221; he responded stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;In one way, you didn&#8217;t; but just the
same ... you had both hands reached out
to seize me when I fell. You never tried to
help me; you were always digging the pitfall
under my feet. You were forever holding
out your hand with money in it; and there
was you on one side of me with your money,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
and my father on the other with his never-ending
talk about poverty and debts and his
fear of you&mdash;and you know you took pains to
make him fear you&mdash;and his saying always
that it wouldn&#8217;t make any difference in what
people thought of me, whether I stood out
against you or....&#8221; Her glance shifted and
fell. There were some things she could not
put into words.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s book talk, Sylvia. Come out into
the open. I know what the female nature is.
You&#8217;re all alike. You all know when to
lower your eyes and lift your fan and back
into a corner. That&#8217;s the female&#8217;s job, just
as it&#8217;s the male&#8217;s job to be bold and rough.
But you all know to a hair how far to carry
that sort of thing. You always stop in plenty
of time to get caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him curiously. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221;
she said after a pause, &#8220;that roughly describes
certain love-making processes. But it really
wasn&#8217;t love-making between you and me,
Fectnor. It was a kind of barter.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes seemed to snare hers relentlessly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not doing yourself justice, Sylvia,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re not one of the bartering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
kind. You&#8217;d have killed me&mdash;you&#8217;d have
killed yourself&mdash;before you&#8217;d have let me
touch you, if you hadn&#8217;t liked me. You
know that&#8217;s a fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shadow of a frown darkened her brow.
&#8220;There was a time when you had a kind of
fascination for me. The way you had of
making other men seem little and dumb,
when you came in and spoke. You seemed
so much alive. I noticed once that you
didn&#8217;t count your change when you&#8217;d paid
for some drinks. That was the way in everything
you did. You seemed lavish with
everything that was in you; you let the big
things go and didn&#8217;t worry about the change.
You were a big man in some ways, Fectnor.
A girl needn&#8217;t have been ashamed of admiring
you. But Fectnor ... I&#8217;ve come to
see what a low life it was I was leading. In
cases like that, what the woman yields is ... is
of every possible importance to her,
while the man parts only with his money.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smote the table with his fist. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad you said that,&#8221; he cried triumphantly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a lie in that, and I want to nail it.
The man gives only his money, you say.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
Do you understand what that means where
a hard-working devil is concerned? What
has he got besides the few pennies he earns?
When he gives his money, isn&#8217;t he giving his
strength and his youth? Isn&#8217;t he giving his
manhood? Isn&#8217;t he giving the things that
are his for only a few years, and that he
can&#8217;t get back again? I&#8217;m not talking about
the dandies who have a lot of money they
never earned. I should think a woman with
as much as one bone in her body would take
a shotgun to that sort whenever they came
around. I&#8217;m talking about the fellows that
sweat for what they get. A lot of mollycoddles
and virtuous damn fools have built
up that Sunday-school junk about the woman
giving everything, and the man giving nothing.
But I want to tell you it&#8217;s nip and
tuck as to who gives the most. A woman
takes a man&#8217;s money as if it grew on bushes.
Go and watch him earn it, if you want to
know what his part of the bargain is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt as if she were being crowded
against a wall. She could not look at him.
She groped for a weapon&mdash;for any weapon&mdash;with
which to fight him. &#8220;That would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
sound a little more impressive, Fectnor,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;if I didn&#8217;t know what brought you to
Eagle Pass just now, and how you sweat for
the pay you got.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was unfortunately said, for there was
malice in it, and a measure of injustice. He
heard her calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;This election business is only a side-line
of mine,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;I enjoy it. There&#8217;s
nothing like knowing you can make a lot
of so-called men roll over and play dead.
If a man wants to find out where he stands,
let him get out and try to make a crowd do
something. Let him try to pull any prunes-and-prism
stuff, either with his pocketbook or
his opinions, and see where he gets off at.
No, Sylvia, you played the wrong card.
Eleven months out of the year I work like
a nigger, and if you don&#8217;t know it, you&#8217;d
better not say anything more about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He clasped his hands about his knee and
regarded her darkly, yet with a kind of joyousness.
There was no end of admiration in
his glance, but of kindness there was never
a suggestion.</p>
<p>She gathered new energy from that look
in his eyes. After all, they had been arguing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
about things which did not matter now.
&#8220;Fectnor,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure there must
be a good deal of justice in what you say.
But I know you&#8217;re forgetting that when the
man and the woman are through with youth
there is a reckoning which gives the man all
the best of it. His wrong-doing isn&#8217;t stamped
upon him. He is respected. He may be
poor, but he isn&#8217;t shunned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more of the same lie. Did you
ever see a poor man&mdash;a really poor man&mdash;who
was respected? There may be two or
three of the people who know him best who
will give him credit for certain things&mdash;if
he denies himself to pay a debt, or forfeits
his rest to sit up with a sick neighbor. But
take the world as a whole, doesn&#8217;t it ride
over the man who&#8217;s got nothing? Isn&#8217;t he
dreaded like a plague? Isn&#8217;t he a kill-joy?
I don&#8217;t care what a woman&#8217;s been, she&#8217;s as
well off. A few people will give her credit
for the good she does, and that&#8217;s all a man
can hope for, if he&#8217;s been generous enough
or enough alive to let his money go. No,
you can&#8217;t build up any fences, Sylvia. We&#8217;re
all in the same herd.&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt oppressed by the hardness, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
relentlessness, of his words, his manner. She
could not respond to him. But she knew that
everything this man said, and everything he
was, left out of the account all those qualities
which make for hope and aspirations and
faith.</p>
<p>Her glance, resting upon him as from a
great distance, seemed to irritate him. &#8220;After
all, Sylvia,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you&#8217;re putting on an
awful lot of silk that don&#8217;t belong to you.
Suppose we say that you&#8217;d have kept away
from me if you hadn&#8217;t been too much
influenced. There are other things to be
remembered. Peterson, for example. Remember
Peterson? I watched you and him
together a good bit. You&#8217;ll never tell me
you wasn&#8217;t loose with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Much of her strength and pride returned
to her at this. Whatever the truth was, she
knew that Fectnor had no right to bring
such a charge against her. &#8220;Your language
is very quaint at times,&#8221; she said. A curve
of disdain hovered about her lips. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
aware of being, or of ever having been, loose
in any way. I can&#8217;t think where such a
word originated.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean well enough.
And some of those young fellows&mdash;the soldiers
and railroaders&mdash;I don&#8217;t suppose any of them
have got anything on you, either?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t, Fectnor!&#8221; she exclaimed
hotly. She resolved to have nothing more
to say to him. She felt that his brutality
gave her the right to have done with him.
And then her glance was arrested by his
powerful hand, where it lay on the table
beside him. It was blunt-fingered and broad
and red, with the back covered by yellow
hairs which extended down to the dabs of
finger-nails.</p>
<p>He seemed to read her mind, and in answer
he took up a heavy pewter cup and held
it toward her. For an instant he permitted
her to scrutinize the cup, and then his fingers
closed. He opened his hand and the shapeless
mass of pewter fell to the floor. He
threw his head back with the ecstasy of
perfect physical fitness. His laughter arose,
almost hysterically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fectnor!&#8221; she cried, standing tense and
white before him, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re all brute&mdash;just
common, hopeless brute.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>He became perfectly serious; but presently
he regarded her with a flicker of humor
in his eyes, she thought. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t say
that as if you meant it, Sylvia,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;You didn&#8217;t say it as if you quite believed
it. But I&#8217;m going to show you that you&#8217;re
right. What we&#8217;ve been together, Sylvia,
you and I, we&#8217;re going to continue to be
until we both agree to quit. That&#8217;s what
you may call justice. And so far I&#8217;m not
agreeing to quit.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came toward her then, and she perceived
that his bearing had altered completely.
He seemed moved by some impulse
stronger than himself&mdash;as if it were quite
outside himself.</p>
<p>She felt that her heart had suddenly
ceased to beat. A leopard crouching before
her on a limb could not have seemed more
pitiless, more terrible. She had sprung to
the door opening into her father&#8217;s room before
he could reach her. Her fingers shot
the bolt and the door was open. And then
she knew she had made a fatal mistake in
holding that long and quiet parley with the
beast that had trapped her. She had led
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
her father, doubtless, to believe that it was
an amicable talk that had been going on
behind the closed door. She knew now that
at the first instant of Fectnor&#8217;s appearance
she should have given battle and cried for
help.</p>
<p>Now, looking into the adjoining room,
while Fectnor&#8217;s grip closed upon her wrist,
she saw the front door quietly close. Her
father had gone out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XIV</p>
</div>

<p>Sylvia climbed the hill in the dusk.</p>
<p>A casual observer would have remarked
that all was not right with her. Beneath a
calm exterior something brooded. You might
have supposed that some of the trivial things
of existence had gone wrong: that a favorite
servant had left her, or that the dressmaker
had failed to keep an appointment. Sylvia
was not an unschooled creature who would
let down the scroll of her life&#8217;s story to be
read by every idle eye.</p>
<p>But the gods of the desert, if any such
there be&mdash;the spirit of the yucca and the cactus
and the sage&mdash;must have known by the
lines of that immobile face, by the unseeing
stare in those weary eyes, that some fundamental
change had come over the woman
who passed along that road. Sylvia had
seemed almost like a happy child when she
descended the hill an hour before. It was a
woman who fashioned a new philosophy of
life who now returned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>It was her own father who had bade her
come; it was the man she loved&mdash;for whom
she had meant to create her life anew&mdash;who
had bade her go; and it was one to whom she
had never told an untruth, for whose pleasure
she had been beautiful and gay, who had destroyed
her.</p>
<p>She had not fully realized how beautiful a
thing her new security had been; how deeply
in her nature the roots of a new hope, of a
decent orderliness had taken hold. But the
transplanted blossom which had seemed to
thrive naturally under the fostering care of
Harboro&mdash;as if it had never bloomed elsewhere
than in his heart&mdash;had been ruthlessly
torn up again. The seeming gain had been
turned into a hideous loss.</p>
<p>And so over that road where a woman with
illusions had passed, a philosopher who no
longer dreamed returned.</p>
<p>Harboro, from his seat on the balcony,
saw her coming. And something which surrounded
her like an aura of evil startled him.
He dropped his newspaper to the floor and
leaned forward, his pulse disturbed, his muscles
tense. As she drew nearer he arose with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the thought of hurrying down-stairs to meet
her; and then it occurred to him that she
would wish to see him alone, away from the
averted eyes of old Antonia, which saw everything.</p>
<p>A little later he heard her coming up the
stairs with heavy, measured steps. And in
that moment he warned himself to be calm,
to discount the nameless fears&mdash;surely baseless
fears&mdash;which assailed him.</p>
<p>She appeared in the doorway and stood,
inert, looking at him as from a great distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Sylvia?&#8221; he said gently. He was
seated now, and one arm was stretched out
over the arm of his chair invitingly. He tried
to smile calmly.</p>
<p>She did not draw any nearer to him. Her
face was almost expressionless, save that her
eyes seemed slowly to darken as she regarded
him. And then he saw that certain muscles
in her face twitched, and that this tendency
swiftly strengthened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sylvia!&#8221; he exclaimed, alarmed. He
arose and took a step toward her.</p>
<p>She staggered toward him and rested her
hands on his shoulders. Her eyes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
averted, and Harboro realized with a pang
that she did not touch him with the familiar
touch which seemed to call to something
within him to respond, to make itself manifest.
She was merely seeking for support
such as a wall or a gate might afford to one
who is faint.</p>
<p>He touched her face with his hand and
brought it about so that he could read her
eyes; but this movement she resisted&mdash;not
irritably, but hopelessly. He slipped an arm
around her yearningly, and then the storm
within her broke.</p>
<p>He thought she must be suffocating. She
gasped for breath, lifting her chin high. She
was shaken with sobs. She clasped his head
in her hands and placed her face against it&mdash;but
the movement was despairing, not loving.</p>
<p>He tried again to look into her eyes; and
presently he discovered that they were quite
dry. It seemed she had lost the power to
weep; yet her sobs became rhythmic, even&mdash;like
those of any woman who grieves deeply
and is still uncomforted.</p>
<p>He held her tenderly and spoke her name
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
over and over. The tears would come soon,
and when she had wept he could ask her to
tell him what it was that had wounded her.
He was suffering cruelly; he was in despair.
But he admonished himself firmly to bear
with her, to comfort her, to wait.</p>
<p>And at last, as if indeed she had been leaning
against a wall for support until she could
recover herself, she drew away from him.
She was almost calm again; but Harboro
realized that she was no nearer to him than
she had been when first she had climbed the
stairs and stood before him.</p>
<p>He placed a firm hand on her shoulder
and guided her to a chair. He sat down
and pulled her gently down to him. &#8220;Now,
Sylvia!&#8221; he said with firmness.</p>
<p>She was kneeling beside him, her elbows
on his knees, her face in her hands. But the
strange remoteness was still there. She would
not look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; he admonished. &#8220;I am waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him then; but she wore the
expression of one who does not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something has gone wrong,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
&#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve not been impatient with you.
But you ought to tell me now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean I ought to tell you what&#8217;s gone
wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was startled by the even, lifeless quality
of her voice. &#8220;Of course!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In just a word or two, I suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>She knelt where she could look away
toward the west&mdash;toward Mexico; and she
noted, with mild surprise, that a new moon
hung low in the sky, sinking slowly into the
desert. It seemed to her that years had
passed since she had seen the moon&mdash;a full
moon, swinging, at this hour of the evening,
in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Sylvia!&#8221; It was Harboro&#8217;s urgent
voice again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I only could!&#8221; she said, moving a little
in token of her discomfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, if any of us could ever say what
it is that has gone wrong. Everything has
gone wrong. From the very beginning. And
now you ask me: &#8216;What&#8217;s gone wrong?&#8217; just
as you might ask, &#8216;What time is it, Sylvia?&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
or, &#8216;Who is it coming up the road?&#8217; I can&#8217;t
tell you what&#8217;s gone wrong. If I talked to
you a week&mdash;a month&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t tell you
half of it. I don&#8217;t believe I ever could. I
don&#8217;t believe I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>These vagaries might have touched Harboro
at another time; they might have
alarmed him. But for the moment wrath
stirred in him. He arose almost roughly.
&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I shall go to your
father. I shall have the facts.&#8221;</p>
<p>This angry reference to her father&mdash;or
perhaps it was the roughness of his withdrawal
from her&mdash;affected her in a new way.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you must not do that!&#8221; she cried
despairingly, and then the tears came suddenly&mdash;the
tears which had stubbornly refused
to flow.</p>
<p>&#8220;There,&#8221; he said, instantly tender again,
&#8220;you&#8217;ll feel better soon. I won&#8217;t be impatient
with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Sylvia&#8217;s tears were only incidental to
some lesser fear or grief. They did not spring
from the wrong she had suffered, or from the
depths of her nature, which had been dwarfed
and darkened. She listlessly pulled a chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
into a better position and sat down where
she need not look at Harboro. &#8220;Give me a
little time,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You know women
have moods, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; She tried to speak
lightly. &#8220;If there is anything I can tell you,
I will&mdash;if you&#8217;ll give me time.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had no intention of telling Harboro
what had happened. The very thought of
such a course was monstrous. Nothing could
be undone. She could only make conditions
just a little worse by talking. She realized
heavily that the thing which had happened
was not a complete episode in itself; it was
only one chapter in a long story which had
its beginnings in the first days in Eagle Pass,
and even further away. Back in the San
Antonio days. She could not give Harboro
an intelligent statement of one chapter without
detailing a long, complicated synopsis of
the chapters that went before.</p>
<p>To be sure, she did not yet know the man
she was dealing with&mdash;Harboro. She was
entirely misled by the passive manner in
which he permitted her to withdraw from
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall have time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
only want you to know that I am here to
help you in any way I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>She remained silent so long that he became
impatient again. &#8220;Did you find your
father very ill?&#8221; he hazarded.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father? Oh! No ... I can hardly
say. He seemed changed. Or perhaps I only
imagined that. Perhaps he really is very
ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another long silence ensued. Harboro
was searching in a thousand dark places for
the cause of her abnormal condition. There
were no guide-posts. He did not know Sylvia&#8217;s
father. He knew nothing about the
life she had led with him. He might be a
cruel monster who had abused her&mdash;or he
might be an unfortunate, unhappy creature,
the very sight of whom would wound the
heart of a sensitive woman.</p>
<p>He leaned forward and took her arm and
drew her hand into his. &#8220;I&#8217;m waiting, Sylvia,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>She turned toward him with a sudden passion
of sorrow. &#8220;It was you who required
me to go!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;If only you hadn&#8217;t
asked me to go!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I thought we were both doing what was
right and kind. I&#8217;m sorry if it has proved
that we were mistaken. But surely you do
not blame me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blame you? No ... the word hadn&#8217;t
occurred to me. I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t understand
our language very well. Who could
ever have thought of such a meaningless
word as &#8216;blame&#8217;? You might think little
creatures&mdash;ants, or the silly locusts that sing
in the heat&mdash;might have need of such a word.
You wouldn&#8217;t <i>blame</i> an apple for being deformed,
would you?&mdash;or the hawk for killing
the dove? We are what we are&mdash;that&#8217;s
all. I don&#8217;t blame any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bewildered Harboro leaned forward,
his hands on his knees. &#8220;We are what we
make ourselves, Sylvia. We do what we permit
ourselves to do. Don&#8217;t lose sight of that
fact. Don&#8217;t lose sight of the fact, either, that
we are here, man and wife, to help each other.
I&#8217;m waiting, Sylvia, for you to tell me what
has gone wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>All that she grasped of what he said she
would have denied passionately; but the
iron in his nature, now manifesting itself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
again, she did not understand and she stood
in awe of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me until to-morrow,&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;I think perhaps I&#8217;m ill to-night. You know
how you imagine things sometimes? Give
me until to-morrow, until I can see more
clearly. Perhaps it won&#8217;t seem anything at
all by to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Harboro, pondering darkly, consented
to question her no more that night.</p>
<p>Later he lay by her side, a host of indefinable
fears keeping him company. He could
not sleep. He did not even remotely guess
the nature of her trouble, but he knew instinctively
that the very foundations of her
being had been disturbed.</p>
<p>Once, toward morning, she began to cry
piteously. &#8220;No, oh no!&#8221; The words were
repeated in anguish until Harboro, in despair,
seized her in his arms. &#8220;What is it,
Sylvia?&#8221; he cried. &#8220;No one shall harm
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He held her on his breast and soothed her,
his own face harrowed with pain. And he
noticed that she withdrew into herself again,
and seemed remote, a stranger to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>Then she fell into a sound sleep and
breathed evenly for hours. The dawn broke
and a wan light filled the room. Harboro
saw that her face was the face of Sylvia again&mdash;the
face of a happy child, as it seemed to
him. In her sleep she reached out for him
contentedly and found his throat, and her
fingers rested upon it with little, intermittent,
loving pressures.</p>
<p>Finally she awoke. She awoke, but Harboro&#8217;s
crowning torture came when he saw
the expression in her eyes. The horror of
one who tumbles into a bottomless abyss
was in them. But now&mdash;thank God!&mdash;she
drew herself to him passionately and wept
in his arms. The day had brought back to
her the capacity to think, to compare the
fine edifice she and Harboro had built with
the wreck which a cruel beast had wrought.
She sobbed her strength away on Harboro&#8217;s
breast.</p>
<p>And when the sun arose she looked into
her husband&#8217;s gravely steadfast eyes, and
knew that she must tell the truth. She knew
that there was nothing else for her to do.
She spared her father, inventing little falsehoods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
on his behalf; herself she spared, confessing
no fault of her own. But the truth,
as to how on the night before Fectnor had
trapped her and wronged her in her father&#8217;s
house, she told. She knew that Harboro
would never have permitted her to rest if
she had not told him; she knew that she must
have gone mad if she had not unbosomed herself
to this man who was as the only tree in
the desert of her life.

<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XV</p>
</div>

<p>She was puzzled by the manner in which
he heard her to the end. She expected an
outburst; and she found only that after one
moment, during which his body became rigid
and a look of incredulous horror settled in
his eyes, a deadly quiet enveloped him. He
did not try to comfort her&mdash;and certainly
there was no evidence that he blamed her.
He asked her a few questions when she had
finished. He was not seeking to implicate
her&mdash;she felt certain of that. He merely
wanted to be quite sure of his ground.</p>
<p>Then he got up and began dressing, deliberately
and quietly. It did not occur to
her that he was not putting on the clothes
he usually wore on Sunday, but this deviation
from a rule would not have seemed significant
to her even if she had noticed it.
She closed her eyes and pondered. In Sylvia&#8217;s
world men did not calmly ignore injury.
They became violent, even when violence
could not possibly mend matters. Had Harboro
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
decided to accept the inevitable, the
irremediable, without a word? Her first
thought, last night, had been that she would
probably lose Harboro, too, together with
her peace of mind. He would rush madly
at Fectnor, and he would be killed. Was he
the sort of man who would place discretion
first and pocket an insult?</p>
<p>Oddly, the fear that he would attack Fectnor
changed to a fear that he did not intend
to do so. She could not bear to think of the
man she loved as the sort of man who will
not fight, given such provocation as Harboro
had.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes to look at him, to
measure him anew. But he was no longer in
the room.</p>
<p>Then her fear for him returned with redoubled
force. Quiet men were sometimes
the most desperate, the most unswerving,
she realized. Perhaps he had gone even now
to find Fectnor.</p>
<p>The thought terrified her. She sprang
from the bed and began dressing with feverish
haste. She would overtake him and plead
with him not to go. If necessary, she would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
tell him other things about herself&mdash;about
the reasons she had given Fectnor, long ago,
to believe that she was not a woman to be
respected. Harboro would not forgive her,
in that event. He would leave her. But he
would not go to his death. It seemed to her
quite clear that the only unforgivable sin
she could commit would be to permit Harboro
to die for her sake.</p>
<p>She hurried down into the dining-room.
Ah, Harboro was there! And again she was
puzzled by his placidity. He was standing
at a window, with his back to her, his hands
clasped behind him. He turned when he
heard her. &#8220;It promises to be another warm
day,&#8221; he said pleasantly. Then he turned
and looked out through the kitchen door as
if hinting to Antonia that breakfast might
now be served.</p>
<p>He ate his grapes and poached eggs and
drank his coffee in silence. He seemed unaware
that Sylvia was regarding him with
troubled eyes.</p>
<p>When he arose from the table he turned
toward the hall. As if by an afterthought,
he called back, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be busy for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
little while, Sylvia,&#8221; and she heard him going
up the stairs.</p>
<p>His tone had conveyed a hint that he did
not wish to be disturbed, she thought, but
she could not help being uncomfortably curious.
What was there to be done on a Sunday
morning that could compare in importance
with the obviously necessary task of
helping her to forget the injuries she had suffered?
It was not his way to turn away
from her when she needed him.</p>
<p>She could not understand his conduct at
all. She was wounded; and then she began
to think more directly, more clearly. Harboro
was not putting this thing away from
him. In his way he was facing it. But how?</p>
<p>She noiselessly climbed the stairs and
opened the door of their bedroom.</p>
<p>With great exactitude of movement he
was cleaning a pistol. He had taken it apart
and just now a cylinder of burnished steel
was in his hand.</p>
<p>He frowned when he heard her. &#8220;I am
sorry you came up, Sylvia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I had
an idea I&#8217;d given you to understand....&#8221;</p>
<p>She hurriedly withdrew, closing the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
behind her. She felt an inexplicable elation
as she went down the stairs; yet she felt
that she stood face to face with calamity,
too. Her man was a fighting man, then&mdash;only
he was not a madman. He was the sort
of fighter who did not lose his head. But she
could not picture him as a man skilled in the
brutal work of killing. He was too deliberate,
too scrupulous, for that sort of work.
And Fectnor was neither deliberate nor
scrupulous. He was the kind of man who
would be intently watchful for an advantage,
and who would be elated as he seized that
advantage.</p>
<p>... She would persuade Harboro not to
go, after all. The thing was not known. It
would never be known. Her searching woman&#8217;s
logic brought to her the realization that
the only way to publish the facts broadcast
was for Harboro to seek a quarrel with Fectnor.
He would have to give his reasons.</p>
<p>But when Harboro came down the stairs
she knew instantly that she could not stop
him from going. That quiet look was not
unreadable now. It meant unswerving determination.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>He called to her, his hand outstretched;
and when she went to him he kissed her. His
voice was gentle and unshaken, in quite the
habitual way, when he said: &#8220;<i>I shall be back
in a little while</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She clasped her hands and looked at him
imploringly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; she pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, but I must go.&#8221;</p>
<p>She touched his cheeks with her hands.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t go!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Nothing can
be undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a man&#8217;s job isn&#8217;t to undo things&mdash;it&#8217;s
to do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She held her face high as if the waters were
engulfing her. &#8220;Don&#8217;t go!&#8221; she said again;
and her eyes were swimming, so that at the
last she did not see him go, and did not know
that he had kept that look of placid courage
to the end.</p>
<p>It was a little early for the usual Sunday
morning loiterers to be about as Harboro
entered the town. For a moment he believed
there was no one about at all. The little
town, with its main street and its secondary
thoroughfares bordered by low structures,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
might have been regarded as the habitation
of lesser creatures than human beings, as it
stood there musing after the departed night,
in the midst of limitless wastes of sand.
That group of houses might have been likened
to some kind of larger birds, hugging the
earth in trepidation, ready to take flight at
any moment.</p>
<p>Yet Harboro had been mistaken in supposing
that no one was as yet astir. Two
men stood out in the street, at the entrance
to the Maverick bar, near a hitching-post to
which a small horse carrying a big saddle was
tethered. One of the men was about to
mount. As Harboro approached he untied
his horse and lifted one foot to its stirrup,
and stood an instant longer to finish what he
was saying, or perhaps to hear the other out.</p>
<p>The other man was in his shirt-sleeves. He
carried a blue-serge sack-coat over his arm.
He stood facing Harboro as the latter approached;
and the expression in his eyes
seemed to change in a peculiar way at sight
of the big, swarthy man who stepped off the
sidewalk, down into the street, and seemed to
be headed directly toward him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>The two men had never met before; but
Harboro, taking in that compact, muscular
figure, found himself musing with assurance:
&#8220;That is Fectnor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nothing in his face or carriage betrayed
his purpose, and the man with the blue-serge
garment on his arm kept his ground complacently.
The man with the horse mounted
and rode away.</p>
<p>Harboro advanced easily until he was
within arm&#8217;s length of the other man in the
street. &#8220;You&#8217;re Fectnor, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; replied the other crisply.</p>
<p>Harboro regarded him searchingly. At
length he remarked: &#8220;Fectnor, I see you&#8217;ve
got a gun on you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; was the steely response. Fectnor&#8217;s
narrow blue eyes became, suddenly, the
most alert thing about a body which was all
alertness.</p>
<p>&#8220;So have I,&#8221; said Harboro.</p>
<p>The other&#8217;s narrow eyes seemed to twinkle.
His response sounded like: &#8220;The L you
say!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harboro. He added: &#8220;My
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
wife was the woman you trapped in Little&#8217;s
house last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fectnor&#8217;s mind went swiftly to the weapon
in his holster; and something more than his
mind, surely, since Harboro knew. Yet the
man&#8217;s hand had barely moved. However,
he casually threw the coat he carried over
his left arm, leaving his right hand free. If
he had thought of reaching for his weapon he
had probably realized that he must first get
out of reach of Harboro&#8217;s arm. &#8220;You might
put that a little different,&#8221; he said lightly.
&#8220;You might say&mdash;the woman I met in Little&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro took in the insinuated insult. He
remained unmoved. He could see that Fectnor
was not a coward, no matter what else
he was; and he realized that this man would
seek to enrage him further, so that his eyes
would be blinded, so that his hands would
tremble.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you, Fectnor,&#8221; Harboro
continued. &#8220;But I&#8217;m going to give you a
chance for your life. I want you to turn and
walk down the street twelve paces. Then
turn and draw. I&#8217;ll not draw until you turn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
unless you try to play a trick on me. Your
best chance lies in your doing just as I tell
you to.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fectnor regarded him shrewdly with his
peering, merry eyes. He rather liked Harboro,
so far as first impressions went. Yet
his lips were set in a straight line. &#8220;All
right,&#8221; he drawled amiably. His voice was
pitched high&mdash;almost to a falsetto.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember, you&#8217;d better not draw until
you&#8217;ve turned around,&#8221; advised Harboro.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be more likely to get your bearings
right that way. You see, I want to give you
an even break. If I&#8217;d wanted to murder you
I could have slipped up from behind. You
see that, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear as a whistle,&#8221; said Fectnor. He
gave Harboro a final searching look and
then turned about unflinchingly. He proceeded
a few steps, his hands held before him
as if he were practising a crude cake-walk.
The serge garment depended from one arm.
He was thinking with lightning-like rapidity.
Harboro had courage enough&mdash;that he could
tell&mdash;but he didn&#8217;t behave like a man who
knew very many tricks with a gun. Nevertheless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
he, Fectnor, would be under a disadvantage
in this test of skill which was being
forced upon him. When he turned he would
need just a second to get a perfect balance,
to be quite sure of his footing, to get his bearings.
And that one second might make all
the difference in the outcome of the affair.
Moreover, there was one other point in Harboro&#8217;s
favor, Fectnor realized. His was the
stronger determination of the two. Fectnor had
not flinched, but he knew that his heart was
not in this fight. He could see that Harboro
was a good deal of a man. A fool, perhaps,
but still a decent fellow.</p>
<p>These were conclusions which had come
in flashes, while Fectnor took less than half
a dozen steps. Then he turned his head
partly, and flung back almost amiably: &#8220;Wait
until I get rid of my coat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it!&#8221; cried Harboro sharply.</p>
<p>But Fectnor plainly had another idea. He
turned a little out of his course, still with his
hands well in front of him. It was evident,
then, that he meant to fling his coat on the
sidewalk.</p>
<p>Harboro held him with eyes which were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
keen as knives, yet still a little dubious. He
was puzzled by the man&#8217;s good humor; he
was watchful for sudden stratagems. His
own hands were at his sides, the right within
a few inches of his hip.</p>
<p>Yet, after all, he was unprepared for what
happened. Fectnor leaned forward as if to
deposit his coat on the sidewalk. Then he
seemed to stumble, and in two swift leaps he
had gained the inner side of the walk and had
darted into the inset of the saloon. He was
out of sight in a flash.</p>
<p>As if by some feat in legerdemain Harboro&#8217;s
weapon was in his hand; but it was
a hand that trembled slightly. He had allowed
Fectnor to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>He stared fixedly at that place where Fectnor
had disappeared. His right hand was
held in the position of a runner&#8217;s, and the
burnished steel of the weapon in it caught
the light of the sun. He had acquired the
trick of firing while his weapon was being
elevated&mdash;not as he lowered it; with a movement
like the pointing of a finger. He was
ready for Fectnor, who would doubtless try
to take him by surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>Then he realized that the level rays of the
sun made the whole entrance to the saloon,
with its several facets of glass, a thing of
dazzling opaqueness. He could not see Fectnor
until the latter stepped forth from his
ambush; yet it seemed probable that Fectnor
might be able to see him easily enough
through the glass barricade behind which he
had taken refuge. He might expect to hear
the report of a weapon and the crash of glass
at any instant.</p>
<p>At this realization he had an ugly sensation
at the roots of his hair&mdash;as if his scalp
had gone to sleep. Yet he could only stand
and wait. It would be madness to advance.</p>
<p>So he stood, almost single-mindedly. He
had a disagreeable duty to perform, and he
must perform it. Yet the lesser cells of his
brain spoke to him, too, and he realized that
he must present a shocking sight to law-abiding,
happy people, if any should appear.
He was glad that the street was still deserted,
and that he might reasonably hope
to be unseen.</p>
<p>Then his hand shot forward with the
fierceness of a tiger&#8217;s claw: there had been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
movement in the saloon entrance. Only by
the fraction of a second was the finger on
the trigger stayed.</p>
<p>It was not Fectnor who appeared. Dunwoodie
stepped into sight casually and looked
in Harboro&#8217;s direction. The expression of
amused curiosity in his eyes swiftly gave
place to almost comical amazement when
he took in that spasmodic movement of Harboro&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he inquired. He approached
Harboro leisurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand aside, Dunwoodie,&#8221; commanded
Harboro harshly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, wait a minute,&#8221; insisted Dunwoodie.
&#8220;Calm yourself, man. I want to
talk to you. Fectnor&#8217;s not in the saloon.
He went on through and out the back way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro wheeled with an almost despairing
expression in his eyes. He seemed to
look at nothing, now&mdash;like a bird-dog that
senses the nearness of the invisible quarry.
The thought came to him: &#8220;Fectnor may
appear at any point, behind me!&#8221; The man
might have run back along the line of buildings,
seeking his own place to emerge again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>But Dunwoodie went on reassuringly. He
had guessed the thought in Harboro&#8217;s mind.
&#8220;No, he&#8217;s quite gone. I watched him go.
He&#8217;s probably in Mexico by this time&mdash;or
well on his way, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro drew a deep breath. &#8220;You
watched him go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he came into the saloon, like a
rock out of a sling, he stopped just long
enough to grin, and fling out this&mdash;to me&mdash;&#8216;If
you want to see a funny sight, go out
front.&#8217; Fectnor never did like me, anyway.
Then he scuttled back and out. I followed
to see what was the matter. He made
straight for the bridge road. He was sprinting.
He&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s gun had disappeared. He was
frowning; and then he realized that Dunwoodie
was looking at him with a quizzical
expression.</p>
<p>He made no explanation, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be getting along home,&#8221; he said
shortly. He was thinking of Sylvia.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XVI</p>
</div>

<p>Dunwoodie was not given to talkativeness;
moreover, he was a considerate man,
and he respected Harboro. Therefore it
may be doubted if he ever said anything
about that unexplained drama which occurred
on the main street of Eagle Pass on
a Sunday morning, before the town was
astir. But there was the bartender at the
Maverick&mdash;and besides, it would scarcely
have been possible for any man to do what
Harboro had done without being seen by
numbers of persons looking out upon the
street through discreetly closed windows.</p>
<p>At any rate, there was talk in the town.
By sundown everybody knew there had been
trouble between Harboro and Fectnor, and
men who dropped into the Maverick for a
game of high-five or poker had their attention
called to an unclaimed blue-serge coat
hanging from the ice-box.</p>
<p>&#8220;He got away with his skin,&#8221; was the way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
the bartender put the case, &#8220;but he left his
coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a voice from one of the card-tables:
&#8220;Well, any man that gets Fectnor&#8217;s
coat is no slouch.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were a good many expressions of
undisguised wonder at Fectnor&#8217;s behavior;
and nobody could have guessed that perhaps
some sediment of manhood which had remained
after all the other decent standards
had disappeared had convinced Fectnor that
he did not want to kill a man whom he had
injured so greatly. And from the popular
attitude toward Fectnor&#8217;s conduct there grew
a greatly increased respect for Harboro.</p>
<p>That, indeed, was the main outcome of
the episode, so far as the town as a whole
was concerned. Harboro became a somewhat
looming figure. But with Sylvia ... well,
with Sylvia it was different.</p>
<p>Of course Sylvia was connected with the
affair, and in only one way. She was the
sort of woman who might be expected to
get her husband into trouble, and Fectnor
was the kind of man who might easily appeal
to her imagination. This was the common
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
verdict; and the town concluded that it was
an interesting affair&mdash;the more so because
nearly all the details had to be left to the
imagination.</p>
<p>As for Sylvia, the first direct result of her
husband&#8217;s gun-play was that a week or two
after the affair happened, she had a caller&mdash;the
wife of Jesus Mendoza.</p>
<p>She had not had any callers since her marriage.
Socially she had been entirely unrecognized.
The social stratum represented
by the Mesquite Club, and that lower stratum
identified with church &#8220;socials&#8221; and
similar affairs, did not know of Sylvia&#8217;s existence&mdash;had
decided definitely never to know
of her existence after she had walked down
the aisle of the church to the strains of the
Lohengrin march. Nevertheless, there had
been that trip to the church, and the playing
of the march; and this fact placed Sylvia
considerably above certain obscure women
in the town who were not under public condemnation,
but whose status was even more
hopeless&mdash;who were regarded as entirely negligible.</p>
<p>The wife of Jesus Mendoza was one of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
these. She was an American woman, married
to a renegade Mexican who was
notoriously evil. I have referred to Mendoza
as a man who went about partly
concealed in his own cloud of cigarette smoke,
who looked at nothing in particular and
who was an active politician of a sort. He
had his place in the male activities of the
town; but you wouldn&#8217;t have known he had
a wife from anything there was in his conversation
or in his public appearances. Nobody
remembered ever to have seen the two
together. She remained indoors in all sorts
of weather save when she had marketing to
do, and then she looked neither to left nor
right. Her face was like a mask. She had
been an unfortunate creature when Mendoza
married her; and she was perhaps
thankful to have even a low-caste Mexican
for a husband, and a shelter, and money
enough to pay the household expenses.</p>
<p>That her life could not have been entirely
complete, even from her own way of thinking,
was evidenced by the fact that at last
she came to call on Sylvia in the house on
the Quemado Road.</p>
<p>Sylvia received her with reticence and with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
a knowing look. She was not pleased that
Mrs. Mendoza had decided to call. She
realized just what her own status was in
the eyes of this woman, who had assumed
that she might be a welcome visitor.</p>
<p>But Sylvia&#8217;s outlook upon life, as has been
seen, was distorted in many ways; and she
was destined to realize that she must form
new conclusions as to this woman who had
come to see her in her loneliness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mendoza was tactful and kind. She
assumed nothing, save that Sylvia was not
very thoroughly acquainted in the town, and
that as she had had her own house now for
a month or two, she would expect people to
be neighborly. She discussed the difficulties
of housekeeping so far from the source of
supplies. She was able, incidentally, to give
Sylvia a number of valuable hints touching
these difficulties. She discussed the subject
of Mexican help without self-consciousness.
During her call it developed that she was
fond of music&mdash;that in fact she was (or had
been) a musician. And for the first time since
Sylvia&#8217;s marriage there was music on the
piano up in the boudoir.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Mendoza played with a passionateness
which was quite out of keeping with
her mask-like expression. It was like finding
a pearl in an oyster, hearing her at the
piano. She played certain airs from <i>Fra
Diavolo</i> so skilfully that she seemed to be
letting bandits into the house; and when
she saw that Sylvia was following with deep
appreciation she passed on to the <i>Tower
Scene</i>, giving to the minor chords a quality
of massiveness. Her expression changed
oddly. There was color in her cheeks and a
stancher adjustment of the lines of her face.
She suggested a good woman struggling
through flames to achieve safety. When she
played from <i>Il Trovatore</i> you did not think
of a conservatory, but of a prison.</p>
<p>She stopped after a time and the color
swiftly receded from her cheeks. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid
I&#8217;ve been rather in earnest,&#8221; she said apologetically.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t played on a good
piano for quite a long time.&#8221; She added, as
if her remark might seem an appeal for pity,
&#8220;the climate here injures a piano in a year
or so. The fine sand, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must come and use mine whenever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
you will,&#8221; said Sylvia heartily. &#8220;I love it,
though I&#8217;ve never cared to play myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I could scarcely explain. I&#8217;ve been
too busy living. It has always seemed to
me that music and pictures and books were
for people who had been caught in an eddy
and couldn&#8217;t go on with the stream.&#8221; She
realized the tactlessness of this immediately,
and added: &#8220;That&#8217;s just a silly fancy.
What I should have said, of course, is that
I haven&#8217;t the talent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t spoil it,&#8221; remonstrated the other
woman thoughtfully. &#8220;But you must remember
that few of us can always go on
with the stream.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes you get caught in the whirlpools,&#8221;
said Sylvia, as they were going down
the stairs, &#8220;and then you can&#8217;t stop, even
if you&#8217;d like to.&#8221;</p>
<p>I doubt if either woman derived a great
deal of benefit from this visit. They might
have become helpful friends under happier
conditions; but neither had anything to
offer the other save the white logic of untoward
circumstances and defeat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>The wife of Jesus Mendoza did not know
Sylvia well enough to perceive that a certain
blitheness and faith had abandoned her,
never to return. Nevertheless, the fact of her
visit has its place in this chronicle, since it
had a cruel bearing upon a day which still lay
in Sylvia&#8217;s future.</p>
<p>Sylvia&#8217;s caller went home; and, as it
chanced, she never called again at the house
on the Quemado Road. As for Sylvia, she did
not speak to Harboro of her visitor. From
his point of view, she thought, there would
be nothing to be proud of in the fact that
Mrs. Mendoza had called. And so Harboro
was destined to go on to the end without
knowing that there was any such person as
the wife of Jesus Mendoza.

<p>CHAPTER XVII</p>
</div>

<p>Two events which had a bearing upon
Sylvia&#8217;s destiny occurred at about this time.
I am not sure which came first: the invitation
to a celebration out at the Quemado
settlement, or the arrival on the border of
Runyon, the mounted inspector.</p>
<p>The coming of Runyon caused a distinct
ripple in the social circles of the two border
towns. He was well connected, it was known:
he was a cousin to a congressman in the San
Angelo district, and he had a brother in the
army.</p>
<p>He was a sort of frontier Apollo; a man in
his prime, of striking build&mdash;a dashing fellow.
He had the physical strength, combined
with neatness of lines, which characterized
Buffalo Bill in his younger days. He
was a blond of the desert type, with a shapely
mustache the color of flax, with a ruddy
skin finely tanned by sun and wind, and
with deep blue eyes which flashed and sparkled
under his flaxen brows. He was a manly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
appearing fellow, though there was a glamour
about him which made prosaic folk suspicious.</p>
<p>He rode a dun horse with golden dapples&mdash;a
slim, proud thing which suited Runyon in
every detail. When you saw him mounted
you thought of a parade; you wondered
where the rest of it was&mdash;the supernumerary
complement.</p>
<p>The man was also characterized by the
male contingent of the border as a &#8220;dresser.&#8221;
He was always immaculately clad, despite
the exposure to which his work subjected
him. He seemed to have an artist&#8217;s sense of
color effects. Everything he put on was not
only faultless in itself, but it seemed specially
designed and made for him. In the set of
his sombrero and the style of his spurs he
knew how to suggest rakishness without
quite achieving it; and when he permitted
his spirited horse to give way to its wayward
or playful moods there was something just
a little sinister in his mirth. He looked as
much at home in conventional clothes as in
his inspector&#8217;s outfit, and he immediately
became a social favorite on both sides of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
river. It developed that he could sing quite
amazingly. His voice was high-pitched, but
there was power and fire in it. He sang
easily and he loved to sing. His songs were
the light-opera favorites, the fame of which
reached the border from New York and
London, and even Vienna. And when there
was difficulty about getting the accompaniments
played he took his place unaffectedly
at the piano and played them himself.</p>
<p>His name began to appear regularly in
the Eagle Pass <i>Guide</i> in connection with
social events; and he was not merely mentioned
as &#8220;among those present,&#8221; but there
was always something about his skill as a
musician.</p>
<p>Of course Sylvia was destined to see him
sooner or later, though she stayed at home
with almost morbid fidelity to a resolution
she had made. He rode out the Quemado
Road one matchless December day when
the very air would have seemed sufficient
to produce flowers without calling the ungracious
desert into service. Sylvia sat in
her boudoir by an open window and watched
him approach. She immediately guessed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
that it was Runyon. The remarkable manner
in which he had conquered the town
had made him an occasional subject for
comment between Sylvia and Harboro, and
he had described the man to her.</p>
<p>Sylvia thought that the rider and his
horse, with the sun on the man&#8217;s flashing
blue eyes and the horse&#8217;s golden dapples,
constituted the prettiest picture she had
ever seen. Never before had she observed
a man who sat his horse with such an air of
gallantry.</p>
<p>And as she regarded him appraisingly he
glanced up at her, and there was the slightest
indication of pleased surprise in his
glance. She withdrew from the window; but
when she reckoned that he was well past the
house she looked after him. He was looking
back, and their eyes met again.</p>
<p>It is decidedly contrary to my conviction
that either Sylvia or Runyon consciously
paved the way for future mischief when they
indulged in that second glance at each other.
He was the sort of man who might have attracted
a second glance anywhere, and he
would have been a poor fellow if he had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
considered Sylvia a sight worth turning his
head for.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sylvia regretted that second
glance. It had an effect upon her heart
which was far from soothing; and when she
realized that her heart seemed suddenly to
hurt her, her conscience followed suit and
hurt her too. She closed the window righteously;
though she was careful not to do so
until she felt sure that Runyon was beyond
sight and hearing.</p>
<p>And then there came to Harboro the invitation
out to the Quemado. The belle of
the settlement, a Mexican girl famed for
her goodness and beauty, was to be married
to one of the Wayne brothers, ranchers on
an immense scale. The older of the two
brothers was a conventional fellow enough,
with an American wife and a large family;
but the younger brother was known far and
wide as a good-natured, pleasure-pursuing
man who counted every individual in Maverick
County, Mexican and American alike,
his friend. It seemed that he was planning to
settle down now, and he had won the heart
of a girl who seemed destined to make an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
admirable mate for one of his nature-loving
type, though his brother had mildly opposed
the idea of a Mexican girl as a member of
the family.</p>
<p>The wedding was to be in the fashion of
the bride&#8217;s race. It was to be an affair of
some twenty-four hours&#8217; duration, counting
the dancing and feasting, and it was to take
place in a sort of stockade which served the
Quemado settlement in lieu of a town hall
or a public building of any kind.</p>
<p>Invitations had been practically unlimited
in number. There was to be accommodation
for hundreds. Many musicians had
been engaged, and there was to be a mountain
of viands, a flood of beverages. It was
to be the sort of affair&mdash;democratic and
broadly hospitable&mdash;which any honest man
might have enjoyed for an hour or so, at
least; and it was in that category of events
which drew sightseers from a considerable
distance. Doubtless there would be casual
guests from Spofford (the nearest railroad
point on the Southern Pacific) and from
Piedras Negras, as well as from Eagle Pass
and the remote corners of Maverick County.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s invitation had come to him
through one of his fellow employees in the
railroad offices&mdash;a Mexican who had spent
four years in an American university, and
who was universally respected for his urbane
manner and kind heart. Valdez, his name
was. He had heartily invited Harboro to
go to the wedding with him as his guest;
and when he saw traces of some sort of difficulty
in Harboro&#8217;s manner, he suggested,
with the ready <i>simpatía</i> of his race, that
doubtless there was a Mrs. Harboro also,
and that he hoped Mrs. Harboro, too, would
honor him by accepting his invitation. He
promised that the affair would be enjoyable;
that it would afford an interesting study of
a people whose social customs still included
certain pleasures which dated back to the
Cortez invasion, as well as many of the
latest American diversions.</p>
<p>Harboro tactfully sought for more definite
details; and when he gathered that the
affair would be too immense to be at all
formal&mdash;that there would be introductions
only so far as separate groups of persons
were concerned, and that guests would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
expected to come and go with perfect freedom,
he accepted the invitation gratefully.
He had not forgotten the slight which the
two towns had put upon him and Sylvia, and
he was not willing to subject himself to
snubs from people who had behaved badly.
But he realized that it was necessary for
Sylvia to see people, to get away from the
house occasionally, to know other society
than his own.</p>
<p>In truth, Harboro had been very carefully
taking account of Sylvia&#8217;s needs. It seemed
to him that she had not been really herself
since that Sunday morning when he had had
to place his life in jeopardy. In a way, she
seemed to love him more passionately than
ever before; but not so light-heartedly, so
gladly. Some elfin quality in her nature
was gone, and Harboro would gladly have
brought it back again. She had listless
moods; and sometimes as they sat together
he surprised a strange look in her eyes. She
seemed to be very far away from him; and
he had on these occasions the dark thought
that even the substance of her body was
gone, too&mdash;that if he should touch her she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
would vanish in a cloud of dust, like that
woman in <i>Archibald Malmaison</i>, after she
had remained behind the secret panel, undiscovered,
for a generation.</p>
<p>And so Harboro decided that he and Sylvia
would go to the big affair at the Quemado.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XVIII</p>
</div>

<p>There was an atmosphere of happiness
and bustle in the house when the night of
the outing came. Harboro easily managed a
half-holiday (it was a Saturday), and he
had ample time to make careful selection of
horses for Sylvia and himself at an Eagle
Pass stable. He would have preferred a carriage,
but Sylvia had assumed that they
would ride, and she plainly preferred that
mode of travel. She had been an excellent
horsewoman in the old San Antonio days.</p>
<p>Old Antonia was drawn out of her almost
trance-like introspection. The young señora
was excited, as a child might have been, at
the prospect of a long ride through the
chaparral, and she must not be disappointed.
She had fashioned a riding-habit and a very
charming little jacket, and to these the old
woman made an addition of her own&mdash;a
wonderful <i>rebozo</i>. She brought it forth from
among her own possessions and offered it
affectionately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But shall I need it?&#8221; asked Sylvia.</p>
<p>Very surely she might, she was assured.
She would not wish to dance in her riding
costume, certainly. And it might turn chilly
after nightfall. She would find that other
young women had such garments to protect
them. And this particular <i>rebozo</i> was quite
wonderful. She pointed out its wonderful
qualities. It was of so delicate a weave that
it might have been thrust into a man&#8217;s
pocket; yet, unfolded, it proved to be of
the dimensions of a blanket. And there was
warmth in it. She folded it neatly and explained
how it might be tied to the pommel
of the saddle. It would not be in the way.</p>
<p>Sylvia affected much gratitude for such
kindness and foresight, though she thought
it unlikely that she would need a wrap of
any sort.</p>
<p>There was an early supper, Antonia contributing
a quite unprecedented alacrity;
and then there was a cheerful call from the
road. The horses had been brought.</p>
<p>Sylvia ran out to inspect them; and Harboro,
following, was not a little amazed to
perceive how important a matter she considered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
the sort of horses he had engaged.
Horses were not a mere medium of travel
to Sylvia; they were persons in the drama,
and it was highly important that they should
fit into the various romantic demands of the
occasion. Harboro had stipulated that they
should be safe horses, of good appearance;
and the boy from the stable, who had brought
them, regarded them with beaming eyes
when Harboro examined them. The boy evidently
looked at the affair much as Sylvia
did&mdash;as if the selection of the horse was far
more important than the determining of a
destination.</p>
<p>&#8220;They seem to be all right,&#8221; ventured
Harboro.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they are very good horses,&#8221; agreed
Sylvia; but she sighed a little.</p>
<p>Then there was the clatter of hoofs down
the road, and Valdez appeared. He, too,
bestrode a decidedly prosaic-appearing animal;
but when Harboro exclaimed: &#8220;Ah,
it&#8217;s Valdez!&#8221; Sylvia became more interested
in the man than in the horse. It would be
a pity to have as companion on a long ride
a man without merits. She was not very
favorably impressed by Valdez. The man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
acknowledged his introduction to her too
casually. There were no swift, confidential
messages in his eyes. He seemed to be there
for the purpose of devoting himself to Harboro,
not to her.</p>
<p>Antonia came out to be sure that the
cherished <i>rebozo</i> was tied to the pommel of
Sylvia&#8217;s saddle, and then Harboro and Sylvia
went back into the house to get into their
riding things. When they returned Harboro
lifted her to her saddle with a lack of
skill which brought a frown to her brows.
But if she regretted the absence of certain
established formalities in this performance,
she yielded herself immediately to the ecstasy
of being in the saddle. She easily assumed
a pretty and natural attitude which
made Harboro marvel at her.</p>
<p>She watched when it came time for him
to mount. The horse moved uneasily, as
horses have done since the beginning of time
beneath the touch of unpractised riders. Harboro
gathered the reins in too firm a grip,
and the animal tried to pull away from him.</p>
<p>The boy from the stable sprang forward.
&#8220;Let me hold his head,&#8221; he said, with a too
obvious intimation that Harboro needed help.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Harboro crisply; and
he achieved his place in the saddle by sheer
force rather than by skill. Neither did he
fall into an easy position; though under
ordinary circumstances this fact would not
have been noted. But Sylvia swiftly recalled
the picture of a dun horse with golden dapples,
and of a rider whose very attitude in
the saddle was like a hymn of praise. And
again she sighed.</p>
<p>She had seen Runyon often since the
afternoon on which he had made his first
appearance on the Quemado Road. Seemingly,
his duties took him out that way often;
and he never passed without glancing toward
Sylvia&#8217;s window&mdash;and looking back again
after he had passed. Nor had he often found
that place by the window vacant. In truth,
it was one of Sylvia&#8217;s pleasures in those days
to watch Runyon ride by; and the afternoon
seemed unduly filled with tedium when
he failed to appear.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The little picture in front of Harboro&#8217;s
house dissolved. The three riders turned
their horses&#8217; heads to the north and rode
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
away. Antonia stood at the gate an instant
and looked after them; but she did not derive
any pleasure from the sight. It was not
a very gallant-appearing group. Sylvia was
riding between the two men, and all three
were moving away in silence, as if under
constraint. The stable-boy went somewhat
dispiritedly back along the way he had come.</p>
<p>Sylvia was the first of the three riders
to find herself. There were certain things
which made the springs of gladness within
her stir. The road was perfect. It stretched,
smooth and white, away into the dusk. The
air was clear as on a mountain top, with
just enough crispness to create energy. Of
wind there was scarcely a breath.</p>
<p>She was not pleased at all with Harboro&#8217;s
friend. He had assumed the attitude of a
deferential guide, and his remarks were almost
entirely addressed to Harboro. But she
was not to be put out by so small a part
of the night&#8217;s programme. After all, Valdez
was not planning to return with them, and
they were likely to have the ride back by
themselves. Valdez, she had been informed,
was to be a sort of best friend to the family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
of the bride, and it would be his duty to remain
for the next day&#8217;s ceremonies&mdash;the
feasting and the marriage itself.</p>
<p>The dusk deepened, and a new light began
to glow over the desert. A waxing moon,
half-full, rode near the zenith; and as the
light of day receded it took on a surprising
brilliance. The road seemed in some strange
way to be more clearly defined than under
the light of day. It became a winding path
to happiness. It began to beckon; to whisper
of the delights of swift races, of coquetries.
It bade the riders laugh aloud and
fling their cares away. Occasionally it rose
or dipped; and then through little valleys
between sand-dunes, or from low summits,
the waters of the Rio Grande were visible
away to the left. A mist was clinging to the
river, making more mysterious its undisturbed
progress through the desert.</p>
<p>After a long time the silence of the road
was broken by the tinkle of a small bell,
and Valdez pulled his horse in and looked
sharply away into a mesquite-clad depression.
Of old the road had been haunted by night-riders
who were willing enough to ride away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
with a traveller&#8217;s possessions, leaving the
traveller staring sightlessly toward the sky.
But Valdez thought of no menaces in connection
with the border folk. He was a kind-hearted
fellow, to whom all men were friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travellers, or a party camped for the
night,&#8221; he said interestedly, as if the presence
of other human beings must be welcomed
gladly. He rode out toward the
sound of that tinkling bell, and in a moment
he was guided more certainly by the
blaze of a camp-fire.</p>
<p>Harboro and Sylvia followed, and presently
they were quite near to two quaint
old carts, heaped high with mesquite fagots
destined for the humbler hearths of Eagle
Pass. Donkeys were tethered near by, and
two Mexicans, quite old and docile in appearance,
came forward to greet the intruders.</p>
<p>Valdez exchanged greetings with them.
He knew something of the loneliness of these
people&#8217;s lives, and the only religion he had
was a belief that one must be friendly to
travellers. He produced a flask and invited
the old men to drink; and each did so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
with much nice formality and thoroughly
comprehensive toasts to Harboro and Sylvia.</p>
<p>Then Valdez replaced his flask in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&#8220;God go with you!&#8221; he called as he went
away, and &#8220;God go with you!&#8221; came back
the placid, kindly echo.</p>
<p>And Sylvia realized suddenly that it was
a very good thing indeed to be riding along
that golden road through the desert.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XIX</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro became aware that some one
was staring almost insolently at Sylvia.</p>
<p>They were seated on one of the benches
disposed around the side of the stockade,
and there was a great deal of noise all about
them. In the open space of the stockade
a score or more of young men and women
were dancing to the music of violins and
flutes and &#8217;cellos. Nearly all who were not
dancing were talking or laughing. People
who did not see one another for months at
a time were meeting and expressing their
pleasure in staccato showers of words.</p>
<p>There were other noises in the near-by
corral, in which Valdez had put their horses
away with the other horses; and in still
another place the work of barbecuing large
quantities of meat had begun. A pleasant
odor from the fire and the meat floated fitfully
over the stockade. There was still
an almost singular absence of wind, and the
night was warm for a midwinter night.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>Valdez was remaining for the time being
with his guests, and he was making friendly
comments upon the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s chiefly the young people who are
dancing now,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;But you&#8217;ll
notice men and women of all ages around
in the seats. They will become intoxicated
with the joy of it all&mdash;and maybe with other
things&mdash;later in the night, and then the
dancing will begin in earnest.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the moment an old type of fandango
was being danced&mdash;a dance not wholly unlike
a quadrille, in that it admitted a number
of persons to the set and afforded opportunity
for certain individual exhibitions of
skill.</p>
<p>And then Harboro, glancing beyond Valdez,
observed that a man of mature years&mdash;a
Mexican&mdash;was regarding Sylvia fixedly.
He could not help believing that there was
something of insolence, too, in the man&#8217;s
gaze.</p>
<p>He lowered his voice and spoke to Valdez:
&#8220;That man sitting by himself over there,
the fourth&mdash;the fifth&mdash;from us. Do you
know him?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>Valdez turned casually and seemed to
be taking in the general scene. He brought
his glance back to Harboro without seeming
to have noticed anything in particular.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of your most&mdash;er&mdash;conspicuous
citizens,&#8221; he said with a smile. &#8220;His
name is Mendoza&mdash;Jesus Mendoza. I&#8217;m surprised
you&#8217;ve never met him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never have,&#8221; replied Harboro. He got
up and took a new position so that he sat
between Sylvia and Mendoza, cutting off
the view of her.</p>
<p>She had caught the name. She glanced
interestedly at the man called Jesus Mendoza.
She could not remember ever to have
seen him before; but she was curious to
know something about the man whose wife
had been kind to her, and whose life seemed
somehow tragically lonely.</p>
<p>Mendoza made no sign of recognition of
Harboro&#8217;s displeasure. He arose with a
purposeless air and went farther along the
stockade wall. Sylvia&#8217;s glance followed him.
She had not taken in the fact that the man&#8217;s
presence, or anything that he had done, had
annoyed Harboro. She was wondering what
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
kind of man it was who had captivated and
held the woman who had filled her boudoir
with passionate music, and who knew how
to keep an expressionless mask in place so
skilfully that no one on the border really
knew her.</p>
<p>The fandango came to an end, and the
smooth earth which constituted the floor
of the enclosure was vacated for an instant.
Then the musicians began a favorite Mexican
waltz, and there was a scurrying of young
men and women for places. There was an
eager movement along the rows of seats by
young fellows who sought partners for the
waltz. Custom permitted any man to seek
any disengaged woman and invite her to
dance with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ought to find Wayne and pay our
respects,&#8221; suggested Valdez. &#8220;He will want
to meet Mrs. Harboro, too, of course. Shall
we look for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>They skirted the dancing space, leaving
Sylvia with the assurance that they would
soon return. Harboro was noting, with a
relief which he could scarcely understand,
that he was among strangers. The people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
of Eagle Pass were almost wholly unrepresented
as yet. The few Americans present
seemed to be casual sightseers or ranchmen
neighbors of the bridegroom.</p>
<p>Left alone, Sylvia looked eagerly and a
little wistfully toward the dancers. Her
muscles were yielding to the call of the
violins. She was being caught by the spirit
of the occasion. Here she would have been
wholly in her element but for a vague fear
that Harboro would not like her to yield
unrestrainedly to the prevailing mood. She
wished some one would ask her to dance.
The waltz was wonderful, and there was
plenty of room.</p>
<p>And then she looked up as a figure paused
before her, and felt a thrill of interest as
she met the steady, inquiring gaze of Jesus
Mendoza.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Harboro, I believe?&#8221; he asked.
The voice was musical and the English was
perfect. He shrewdly read the glance she
gave him and then held out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard you spoken of as Mr. Mendoza,&#8221;
she replied. &#8220;Your wife has been very kind
to me.&#8221; She did not offer to make room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
for him on the seat beside her. She had
been relieved of her riding-habit, and she
held Antonia&#8217;s <i>rebozo</i> across her knees. She
had decided not to use it just yet. The
night was still comfortably warm and she
did not like to cover up the pretty Chinese
silk frock she was wearing. But as Mendoza
glanced down at her she placed the
<i>rebozo</i> over one arm as if she expected to
rise.</p>
<p>Mendoza must have noted the movement.
A gleam of satisfaction shone in his
inscrutable eyes&mdash;as when a current of air
removes some of the ash from above a live
coal. &#8220;Will you dance with me?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;When the young fellows overlook so charming
a partner, surely an old man may become
bold.&#8221;</p>
<p>She arose with warm responsiveness, yet
with undefined misgivings. He had an arm
about her firmly in an instant, and when
they had caught step with the music he held
her close to him. He was an excellent dancer.
Sylvia was instantly transported away from
the world of petty discretions into a realm
of faultless harmony, of singing rhythm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>Her color was heightened, her eyes were
sparking, when they returned to their place.
&#8220;It was nice,&#8221; she said, releasing her partner&#8217;s
arm and drawing apart. A purple-and-gold
Chinese lantern glowed just above her head.
And then she realized that Harboro and
Valdez had returned. There was a stranger
with them.</p>
<p>Harboro regarded her with unmistakable
disapproval; but only for an instant. When
something of the childlike glory of her face
departed under the severe expression of his
eyes, he relented immediately. &#8220;Are you enjoying
yourself, Sylvia?&#8221; he inquired gently,
and then: &#8220;I want you to meet our host.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wayne shook hands with her heartily.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a very kind lady to get right into
our merrymaking,&#8221; he said, &#8220;though I hope
you&#8217;ll save a dance for me a little later.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all went to see the bride-to-be then.
She was hidden away in one of the <i>adobe</i>
houses of the settlement near by, receiving
congratulations from friends. She was a
dark little creature, nicely demure and almost
boisterously joyous by turns.</p>
<p>But later Sylvia danced with Wayne,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
and he thought of a dozen, a score, of young
fellows who would wish to meet her. He
brought them singly and in groups, and
they all asked to dance with her. She was
immediately popular. Happiness radiated
from her, and she added to the warmth of
every heart that came within her influence.</p>
<p>Harboro watched her with wonder. She
was like a flame; but he saw her as a sacred
flame.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XX</p>
</div>

<p>Sylvia was resting. She had not danced
to her heart&#8217;s content, but she had become
weary, and she threw Antonia&#8217;s <i>rebozo</i> over
her shoulders and leaned back in her seat.
For the moment Harboro and Valdez and
Wayne were grouped near her, standing.
The girl Wayne was to marry the next day
had made her formal appearance now and
was the centre of attention. She was dancing
with one after another, equally gracious
toward all.</p>
<p>Then Sylvia heard Valdez and Wayne cry
out simultaneously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Runyon!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then both men hurried away toward
the entrance to the stockade.</p>
<p>Sylvia drew her wrap more snugly about
her. &#8220;Runyon!&#8221; she repeated to herself.
She closed her eyes as if she were pondering&mdash;or
recuperating. And she knew that from
the beginning she had hoped that Runyon
would appear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s that inspector fellow,&#8221; explained Harboro,
without looking at her. His tone was
not at all contemptuous, though there was
a note of amusement in it. &#8220;He seems a
sort of Prince Charming that everybody
takes a liking to.&#8221; Wayne and Valdez were
already returning, with Runyon between
them. They pretended to lead him captive
and his face radiated merriment and good
nature. He walked with the elasticity of
a feline creature; he carried his body as if
it were the depository of precious jewels.
Never was there a man to whom nature had
been kinder&mdash;nor any man who was more
graciously proud of what nature had done
for him. For the occasion he was dressed
in a suit of fawn-colored corduroy which
fitted him as the rind fits the apple.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little too much so,&#8221; Harboro was
thinking, ambiguously enough, certainly, as
Runyon was brought before him and Sylvia.
Runyon acknowledged the introduction with
a cheerful urbanity which was quite without
discrimination as between Harboro and
Sylvia. Quite impartially he bestowed a
flashing smile upon both the man and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
woman. And Harboro began vaguely to
understand. Runyon was popular, not because
he was a particularly good fellow, but
because he was so supremely cheerful. And
he seemed entirely harmless, despite the
glamour of him. After all, he was not a
mere male coquette. He was in love with
the world, with life.</p>
<p>Wayne was reproaching him for not having
come sooner. He should have been
there for the beginning, he said.</p>
<p>And Runyon&#8217;s response was characteristic
enough, perhaps: &#8220;Everything is always beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was gay laughter at this, though
the meaning of it must have been obscure
to all save Sylvia. The words sounded like
a song to her. It was a song she had wished
to sing herself. But she was reflecting,
despite her joy in the saying: &#8220;No, everything
is always ending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Runyon was borne away like a conqueror.
He mingled with this group and that. His
presence was like a stimulant. His musical
voice penetrated everywhere; his laughter
arose now and again. He did not look back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
toward Sylvia. She had the strange feeling
that even yet they had not met&mdash;they had
not met, yet had known each other always.
He ignored her, she felt, as one ignores the
best friend, the oldest associate, on the ground
that no explanations are necessary, no misunderstanding
possible.</p>
<p>Harboro sat down beside Sylvia. When he
spoke there was a note of easy raillery in
his voice. &#8220;They&#8217;re getting him to sing,&#8221;
he said, and Sylvia, bringing her thoughts
back from immeasurable distances, realized
that the dancing space had been cleared,
and that the musicians had stopped playing
and were engaged in a low-spoken conference
with Runyon. He nodded toward them
approvingly and then stepped out into the
open, a little distance from them.</p>
<p>The very sky listened; the desert became
dumb. The orchestra played a prelude and
then Runyon began to sing. The words
came clear and resonant:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;By the blue Alsatian mountains</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Dwelt a maiden young and fair....&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Runyon sang marvellously. Although he
was accustomed to the confines of drawing-rooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
with low ceilings, he seemed quite
at home on this earthen floor of the desert,
with the moon sinking regretfully beyond
the top of the stockade. He was perfectly
at ease. His hands hung so naturally by
his sides that they seemed invisible.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;But the blue Alsatian mountains</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Seem to watch and wait alway.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The song of a woman alone, and then
another, &#8220;A Warrior Bold,&#8221; and then &#8220;Alice,
Where Art Thou?&#8221; And finally &#8220;Juanita.&#8221;
They were songs his audience would appreciate.
And all those four songs of tragedy
he sang without banishing the beaming smile
from his eyes. He might have been relating
the woes of marionettes.</p>
<p>He passed from the scene to the sound of
clapping hands, and when he returned almost
immediately after that agreeable theatrical
exit, he began to dance. He danced
with the bride-to-be, and then with the
bridesmaids. He found obscure girls who
seemed to have been forgotten&mdash;who might be
said to have had no existence before he found
them&mdash;and danced with them with natural
gallantry. He came finally to Sylvia, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
she drifted away with him, her hand resting
on his shoulder like a kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you would never come to me,&#8221;
she said in a lifeless voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew I would,&#8221; was the response.</p>
<p>Her lips said nothing more. But her heart
was beating against him; it was speaking to
him with clarity, with eloquence.

<p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro and Sylvia were taking leave of
Wayne and Valdez. Their horses had been
brought and they were in their saddles, their
horses&#8217; heads already in the direction of
Eagle Pass. Valdez was adding final instructions
touching the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re not quite sure of the way I&#8217;ll
get some one to ride in with you,&#8221; said
Wayne; but Harboro would not listen to
this.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll not lose the way,&#8221; he declared;
though there remained in his mind a slight
dubiousness on this point. The moon would
be down before the ride was finished, and
there were not a few roads leading away
from the main thoroughfare.</p>
<p>Then, much to Harboro&#8217;s surprise, Runyon
appeared, riding away from the corral
on his beautiful dun horse. He overheard
the conference between Harboro and the
others, and he made himself one of the
group with pleasant familiarity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Harboro, must you be going, too?&#8221;
he inquired genially; and then: &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll ride with you. It&#8217;s rather
a lonely road at this hour, and I&#8217;ve an idea
I know the way better than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s eyes certainly brightened with
relief. &#8220;It&#8217;s good of you to offer,&#8221; he declared
heartily. &#8220;By all means, ride with
us.&#8221; He turned toward Sylvia, plainly expecting
her to second the invitation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be much pleasanter,&#8221; she said;
though it seemed to Harboro that her words
lacked heartiness. She was busying herself
with the little package at her pommel&mdash;old
Antonia&#8217;s <i>rebozo</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you must all remember that there&#8217;s
one more latch-string out here at the Quemado,&#8221;
said Wayne, &#8220;whenever you feel
inclined to ride this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were off then. The sound of violins
and the shuffle of feet became faint, and the
last gay voice died in the distance. Only
now and then, when the horses&#8217; feet fell in
unison, there drifted after them the note
of a violin&mdash;like a wind at night in an old
casement. And then the three riders were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
presently aware of being quite alone on a
windless waste, with a sentinel yucca standing
on a distant height here and there between
them and the descending moon, and
distant groups of mesquite wreathing themselves
in the silver mist of early morning.
It had been a little past midnight when they
left the Quemado.</p>
<p>Sylvia, riding between the two men, was
so obviously under some sort of constraint
that Harboro sought to arouse her. &#8220;I&#8217;m
afraid you overtaxed yourself, Sylvia,&#8221; he
suggested. &#8220;It&#8217;s all been pleasant, but rather&mdash;heroic.&#8221;
It was an effort for him to speak
lightly and cheerfully. The long ride out to
the Quemado was a thing to which he was
not accustomed, and the merrymaking had
seemed to him quite monotonous after an
hour or two. Even the midnight supper
had not seemed a particularly gay thing to
him. He was not quite a youth any more,
and he had never been young, it seemed to
him, in the way in which these desert folk
were young. Joy seemed to them a kind of
intoxication&mdash;as if it were not to be indulged
in save at long intervals.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t overtax myself,&#8221; replied Sylvia.
&#8220;The ending of things is never very cheerful.
I suppose that&#8217;s what I feel just now&mdash;as
if, at the end, things don&#8217;t seem quite
worth while, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro held to his point. &#8220;You <i>are</i>
tired,&#8221; he insisted.</p>
<p>Runyon interposed cheerfully. &#8220;And there
are always the beginnings,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re
just beginning a new day and a fine ride.&#8221;
He looked at Harboro as if inviting support
and added, in a lower tone: &#8220;And I&#8217;d like
to think we were beginning a pleasant acquaintance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro nodded and his dark eyes beamed
with pleasure. It had seemed to him that
this final clause was the obvious thing for
Runyon to say, and he had waited to see
if he would say it. He did not suppose that
he and Sylvia would see a great deal of
Runyon in Eagle Pass, where they were not
invited to entertainments of any kind, but
there might be occasional excursions into
the country, and Runyon seemed to be invited
everywhere.</p>
<p>But Sylvia refused to respond to this.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
The pagan in her nature reasserted itself,
and she felt resentful of Runyon&#8217;s affable
attitude toward Harboro. The attraction
which she and Runyon exerted toward each
other was not a thing to be brought within
the scope of a conventionally friendly relationship.
Its essence was of the things
furtive and forbidden. It should be fought
savagely and kept within bounds, even if it
could never be conquered, or it should be
acknowledged and given way to in secret.
Two were company and three a crowd in
this case. She might have derived a great
deal of tumultuous joy from Runyon&#8217;s friendship
for her if it could have been manifested
in secret, but she could feel only a sense of
duplicity and shame if his friendship included
Harboro, too. The wolf does not curry favor
with the sheep-dog when it hungers for a
lamb. Such was her creed. In brief, Sylvia
had received her training in none of the
social schools. She was a daughter of the
desert&mdash;a bit of that jetsam which the Rio
Grande leaves upon its arid banks as it
journeys stealthily to the sea.</p>
<p>They were riding along in silence half an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
hour later, their horses at a walk, when the
stillness of the night was rudely shattered
by the sound of iron wheels grinding on
stone, and in an instant a carriage could be
seen ascending a branch road which arose
out of a near-by <i>arroyo</i>.</p>
<p>The riders checked their horses and waited:
not from curiosity, but in response to the
prompting of a neighborly instinct. Travellers
in the desert are never strangers to
one another.</p>
<p>The approaching carriage proved to be
an impressively elegant affair, the locality
considered, drawn by two horses which were
clearly not of the range variety. And then
further things were revealed: a coachman
sat on the front seat, and a man who wore
an air of authority about him like a kingly
robe sat alone on the back seat. Then to
Harboro, sitting high with the last rays of
the moon touching his face, came the hearty
hail: &#8220;Harboro! How are you, Harboro?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the voice of the General Manager.</p>
<p>Harboro turned his horse so that he stood
alongside the open carriage. He leaned
over the wheel and shook hands with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
General Manager. The encounter seemed
to him to add the one desirable touch of
familiarity to the night ride. He explained
his presence away out on the Quemado
Road; and the General Manager also explained.
He had been spending the evening
with friends on a near-by ranch. His
family were remaining for the night, but it
had been necessary for him to return to
Piedras Negras.</p>
<p>Harboro looked about for his companions,
intending to introduce them. But they were
a little too far away to be included comfortably
in such a ceremony. For some reason
Runyon had chosen to ride on a few steps.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many are you?&#8221; inquired the General
Manager, with a note of purposefulness
in his voice. &#8220;Three? That&#8217;s good. You
get in with me. Tie your horse behind. Two
can ride abreast more comfortably than
three, and you and I can talk. I&#8217;ve never
felt so lonesome in my life.&#8221; He moved
over to one side of the seat, and looked back
as if he expected to help in getting Harboro&#8217;s
horse tied behind the carriage. His
invitation did not seem at all like a command,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
but it did seem to imply that a refusal
would be out of the question.</p>
<p>The arrangement seemed quite simple and
desirable to Harboro. He was not a practised
horseman, and he was beginning to
feel the effect of saddle strain. Moreover,
he had realized a dozen times during the
past hour that two could ride easily side by
side on the desert road, while a third rider
was continually getting in the way.</p>
<p>He called to Runyon cheerfully: &#8220;You two
go on ahead&mdash;I&#8217;m going to ride the rest of
the way in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; called back Runyon. To Runyon
everything always seemed precisely ideal&mdash;or
at least such was the impression he created.</p>
<p>It became a little cavalcade now, the
riders leading the way. Riders and carriage
kept close together for a time. Sylvia
remained silent, but she felt the presence of
her companion as a deliciously palpable thing.
Harboro and the General Manager were talking,
Harboro&#8217;s heavy tones alternating at unequal
intervals with the crisp, penetrating
voice of the General Manager&mdash;a voice dry
with years, but vital nevertheless.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>After a time the horses in the carriage
broke into a rhythmic trot. In the darkness
Runyon&#8217;s eyes gleamed with satisfaction.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to have a little canter, or we&#8217;ll
get run over,&#8221; he said gayly, and he and
Sylvia gave rein to their horses.</p>
<p>In a very few minutes they had put a
distance of more than a hundred yards between
them and the occupants of the carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more like it!&#8221; exclaimed Runyon
exultantly. Tone and words alike implied
all too strongly his satisfaction at being rid
of Harboro&mdash;and Sylvia perversely resented
the disloyalty of it, the implication of intrigue
carried on behind a mask.</p>
<p>And then she forgot her scruples. The
boy who had chosen her horse for her had
known what he was doing, after all. The
animal galloped with a dashing yet easy
movement which was delightful. She became
exhilarated by a number of things.
The freedom of movement, the occasional
touch of her knee against Runyon&#8217;s, the
mysterious vagueness of the road, now that
the moon had gone down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>Perhaps they both forgot themselves for
a time, and then Sylvia checked her horse
with a laugh in which there was a sound of
dismay. &#8220;We ought to wait for them to
catch up,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Runyon was all solicitude immediately.
&#8220;We seem to have outdistanced them completely,&#8221;
he said. They turned their horses
about so that they faced the north. &#8220;I
can&#8217;t even hear them,&#8221; he added. Then,
with the irrepressible optimism which was
his outstanding quality, he added laughingly:
&#8220;They&#8217;ll be along in a few minutes. But
wasn&#8217;t it a fine ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had not framed an answer to this
question when her mind was diverted swiftly
into another channel. She held her head
high and her body became slightly rigid.
She glanced apprehensively at Runyon and
realized that he, too, was listening intently.</p>
<p>A faint roar which seemed to come from
nowhere fell on their ears. The darkness
swiftly deepened, so that the man and the
woman were almost invisible to each other.
That sinister roaring sound came closer, as
if mighty waters were rolling toward them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
far away. The northern sky became black,
as if a sable curtain had been let down.</p>
<p>And then upon Sylvia&#8217;s startled senses
the first breath of the norther broke. The
little winds, running ahead as an advance-guard
of the tempest, flung themselves upon
her and caught at her hair and her riding-habit.
They chilled her.</p>
<p>&#8220;A norther!&#8221; she exclaimed, and Runyon
called back through the whistle of the winds:
&#8220;It&#8217;s coming!&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice had the quality of a battle-cry,
joined to the shouts of the descending storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXII</p>
</div>

<p>Fortunately, Runyon knew what to do
in that hour of earth&#8217;s desolation and his
own and Sylvia&#8217;s peril.</p>
<p>He sprang from his horse and drew his
bridle-rein over his arm; and then he laid
a firm hand on the bridle of Sylvia&#8217;s horse.
His own animal he could trust in such an
emergency; but the other had seemed to
lose in height and he knew that it was trembling.
It might make a bolt for it at any
moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your seat,&#8221; he shouted to Sylvia,
and she realized that he was leading both
horses away from the road. She caught
glimpses of his wraith-like figure as the
whirling dust-cloud that enveloped them
thinned occasionally.</p>
<p>She knew that he had found a clump of
mesquite after a faltering progress of perhaps
fifty yards. Their progress was checked,
then, and she knew he was at the hitching
straps, and that he was tethering the animals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
to the trees. The powdered dust and sand
were stinging her face, and the cold wind was
chilling her; yet she felt a strange elation
as she realized that she was here alone with
Runyon, and that he was managing the
situation with deftness and assurance.</p>
<p>She felt his hand groping for her then,
and, leaning forward, she was borne to the
ground. He guided her to a little depression
and made her understand that she was to
sit down. He had removed his saddle-blanket
and spread it on the earth, forming
a rug for her. &#8220;The <i>rebozo</i>?&#8221; he cried in
her ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fastened to the pommel,&#8221; she called
back.</p>
<p>She could neither see nor hear him; but
soon he was touching her on the shoulders.
The <i>rebozo</i> was flung out on the wind so that
it unfolded, and he was spreading it about her.</p>
<p>She caught his hand and drew him close
so that she could make herself heard.
&#8220;There&#8217;s room under it for two,&#8221; she said.
She did not release his hand until he had
sat down by her. Together they drew the
<i>rebozo</i> about them like a little tent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></p>
<p>Immediately they were transformed into
two sheltered and undismayed Arabs. The
<i>rebozo</i> was pinioned behind them and under
their feet. The finest dust could not penetrate
its warp and woof. The wind was as
a mighty hand, intent upon bearing them to
earth, but it could not harm them.</p>
<p>Sylvia heard Runyon&#8217;s musical laugh. He
bent his head close to hers. &#8220;We&#8217;re all right
now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>He had his arm across her shoulder and
was drawing her close. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to be
cold,&#8221; he said, as if in explanation. He
seemed as joyous as a boy&mdash;as innocent as
a boy. She inclined her head until it rested
on his shoulder, so that both occupied little
more than the space of one. The storm
made this intimacy seem almost natural;
it made it advantageous, too.</p>
<p>And so the infinite sands swarmed over
them, and the norther shrieked in their
ears, and the earth&#8217;s blackness swallowed
them up until they seemed alone as a man
and a woman never had been alone before.</p>
<p>The <i>rebozo</i> sagged about them at intervals,
weighted down with the dust; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
again it rippled like a sail when an eccentric
gust swept away the accumulated sediment.</p>
<p>The desert was a thing of blank darkness.
A protected torch would have been invisible
to one staring toward it a dozen steps away.
A temporary death had invaded the world.
There was neither movement nor sound save
the frenzied dance of dust and the whistle
of winds which seemed shunted southward
from the north star.</p>
<p>Runyon&#8217;s hand travelled soothingly from
Sylvia&#8217;s shoulder to her cheek. He held
her to him with a tender, eloquent pressure.
He was the man, whose duty it was to protect;
and she was the woman, in need of
protection.</p>
<p>And Sylvia thought darkly of the ingenuities
of Destiny which set at naught
the petty steps which the proprieties have
taken&mdash;as if the gods were never so diverted
as when they were setting the stage for
tragedy, or as if the struggles and defeats
of all humankind were to them but a proper
comedy.</p>
<p>But Runyon was thinking how rare a
thing it is for a man and a woman to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
quite alone in the world; how the walls
of houses listen, and windows are as eyes
which look in as well as out; how highways
forever hold their malicious gossips to note
the movements of every pair who do not
walk sedately; how you may mount the
stairway of a strange house&mdash;and encounter
one who knows you at the top, and who
laughs in his sleeve; how you may emerge
from the house in which you have felt safe
from espionage&mdash;only to encounter a familiar
talebearer at the door.</p>
<p>But here indeed were he and Sylvia alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXIII</p>
</div>

<p>Before the next spring came two entirely
irreconcilable discoveries were made in Eagle
Pass.</p>
<p>The first of these was made by certain
cronies of the town who found their beer
flat if there was not a bit of gossip to go
with it, and it was to the effect that the
affair between Sylvia and Runyon was sure
to end disastrously if it did not immediately
end otherwise.</p>
<p>The other discovery was made by Harboro,
and it was to the effect that Sylvia
had at last blossomed out as a perfectly
ideal wife.</p>
<p>A certain listlessness had fallen from her
like a shadow. Late in the winter&mdash;it was
about the time of the ride to the Quemado,
Harboro thought it must have been&mdash;a
change had come over her. There was a
glad tranquillity about her now which was
as a tonic to him. She was no longer given
to dark utterances which he could not understand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
She was devoted to him in a gentle,
almost maternal fashion&mdash;studying his needs
and moods alertly and affectionately. Something
of the old tempestuous ardor was
gone, but that, of course, was natural. Harboro
did not know the phrases of old Antonia
or he would have said: &#8220;It is the time
of embers.&#8221; She was softly solicitous for
him; still a little wistful at times, to be
sure; but then that was the natural Sylvia.
It was the quality which made her more
wonderful than any other woman in the
world.</p>
<p>And Sylvia? Sylvia had found a new
avenue of escape from that tedium which
the Sylvias of the world have never been
able to endure.</p>
<p>Not long after that ride to the Quemado a
horse had been brought to her front gate during
a forenoon when Harboro was over the
river at work. Unassisted she had mounted
it and ridden away out the Quemado Road.
A mile out she had turned toward the Rio
Grande, and had kept to an indistinct trail
until she came to a hidden <i>adobe</i> hut, presided
over by an ancient Mexican.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>To this isolated place had come, too,
Runyon&mdash;Runyon, whose dappled horse had
been left hidden in the mesquite down by
the river, where the man&#8217;s duties lay.</p>
<p>And here, in undisturbed seclusion, they
had continued that intimacy which had
begun on the night of the norther. They
were like two children, forbidden the companionship
of each other, who find something
particularly delicious in an unguessed rendezvous.
All that is delightful in a temporary
escape from the sense of responsibility was
theirs. Their encounters were as gay and
light as that of two poppies in the sun,
flung together by a friendly breeze. They
were not conscious of wronging any one&mdash;not
more than a little, at least&mdash;though the
ancient genius of the place, a Mexican who
had lost an eye in a jealous fight in his youth,
used to shake his head sombrely when he
went away from his hut, leaving them alone;
and there was anxiety in the glance of that
one remaining eye as he kept a lookout over
the trail, that his two guests might not be
taken by surprise.</p>
<p>Sometimes they remained in the hut
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
throughout the entire noon-hour, and on these
occasions their finely discreet and taciturn
old host placed food before them. Goat&#8217;s
milk was brought from an earthenware vessel
having its place on a wooden hook under the
eaves of the house; and there was a delicious
stew of dried goat&#8217;s flesh, served with a
sauce which contained just a faint flavor of
peppers and garlic and herbs. And there
was <i>pan</i>, as delicate as wafers, and coffee.</p>
<p>Time and again, throughout the winter,
the same horse made its appearance at
Sylvia&#8217;s gate at the same hour, and Sylvia
mounted and rode away out the Quemado
Road and disappeared, returning early in
the afternoon.</p>
<p>If you had asked old Antonia about these
movements of her mistress she would have
said: &#8220;Does not the señora need the air?&#8221;
And she would have added: &#8220;She is young.&#8221;
And finally she would have said: &#8220;I know
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is a matter of knowledge that occasionally
Sylvia would meet the boy from
the stable when he arrived at the gate and
instruct him gently to take the horse away,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
as she would not require it that day; and I
am not sure she was not trying still to fight
the battle which she had already lost; but
this, of course, is mere surmise.</p>
<p>And then a little cog in the machine
slipped.</p>
<p>A ranchman who lived out on the north
road happened to be in Eagle Pass one evening
as Harboro was passing through the
town on his way home from work. The
ranchman&#8217;s remark was entirely innocent,
but rather unfortunate. &#8220;A very excellent
horsewoman, Mrs. Harboro,&#8221; he remarked,
among other things.</p>
<p>Harboro did not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I met her riding out the road this forenoon,&#8221;
explained the ranchman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; said Harboro. &#8220;Yes, she
enjoys riding. I&#8217;m sorry, on her account, that
I haven&#8217;t more liking for it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went on up the hill, pondering. It
was strange that Sylvia had not told him
that she meant to go for a ride. She usually
went into minute details touching her outings.</p>
<p>He expected her to mention the matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
when he got home, but she did not do so.
She seemed disposed not to confide in him
throughout the entire evening, and finally
he remarked with an air of suddenly remembering:
&#8220;And so you went riding to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>She frowned and lowered her eyes. She
seemed to be trying to remember. &#8220;Why,
yes,&#8221; she said, after a moment&#8217;s silence.
&#8220;Yes, I felt rather dull this morning. You
know I enjoy riding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know you do,&#8221; he responded cordially.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like you to go often, if you&#8217;ll be careful
not to take any chances.&#8221; He smiled at
the recollection of the outcome of that ride
of theirs to the Quemado, and of the excitement
with which they compared experiences
when they got back home. Sylvia and
Runyon had made a run for it and had got
home before the worst of it came, she had
said. But Harboro and the General Manager
had waited until the storm had spent itself,
both sitting in the carriage with their handkerchiefs
pressed to their nostrils, and their
coats drawn up about their heads. He remembered,
too, how the dust-fog had lingered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
in the air until well into the next day,
like a ghost which could not be laid.</p>
<p>He brought himself back from the recollection
of that night. &#8220;If you like, I&#8217;ll have
the horse sent every day&mdash;or, better still,
you shall have a horse of your own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Sylvia, &#8220;I might not care
to go often.&#8221; She had let her hair down
and was brushing it thoughtfully. &#8220;The
things which are ordered for you in advance
are always half spoiled,&#8221; she added. &#8220;It&#8217;s
better to think of things all of a sudden,
and do them.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her in perplexity. That
wasn&#8217;t his way, certainly; but then she was
still occasionally something of an enigma to
him. He tried to dismiss the matter from his
mind. He was provoked that it came back
again and again, as if there were something
extraordinary about it, something mysterious.
&#8220;She only went for a ride,&#8221; he said to
himself late at night, as if he were defending
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXIV</p>
</div>

<p>A month later Harboro came home one
afternoon to find an envelope addressed to
him on the table in the front hall.</p>
<p>He was glad afterward that Sylvia was
engaged with Antonia in the dining-room,
and did not have a chance to observe him as
he examined the thing which that envelope
contained.</p>
<p>It was a statement from one of the stables
of the town, and it set forth the fact that
Harboro was indebted to the stable for
horse-hire. There were items, showing that
on seven occasions during the past month
a horse had been placed at the disposal of
Mrs. Harboro.</p>
<p>Harboro was almost foolishly bewildered.
Sylvia had gone riding seven times during
the month, and she had not even mentioned
the matter to him! Clearly here was a mystery.
Her days were not sufficiently full of
events to make seven outings a matter of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
little consequence to her. She was not
given to reticence, even touching very little
things. She had some reason for not wishing
him to know of these movements of
hers.</p>
<p>But this conclusion was absurd, of course.
She would understand that the bill for services
rendered would eventually come to
him. He was relieved when that conclusion
came to him. No, she was not seeking
to make a mystery out of the matter. Still,
the question recurred: Why had she avoided
even the most casual mention of these outings?</p>
<p>He replaced the statement in the envelope
thoughtfully and put it away in his pocket.
He was trying to banish the look of dark
introspection from his eyes when Sylvia
came in from the kitchen and gave a little
cry of joy at sight of him. She <i>was</i> happy
at the sight of him&mdash;Harboro knew it. Yet
the cloud did not lift from his brow as he
drew her to him and kissed her slowly. She
was keeping a secret from him. The conclusion
was inescapable.</p>
<p>His impulse was to face the thing frankly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
affectionately. He had only to ask her to
explain and the thing would be cleared up.
But for the first time he found it difficult
to be frank with her. If the thing he felt
was not a sense of injury, it was at least a
sense of mystery: of resentment, too. He
could not deny that he felt resentful. At
the foundation of his consciousness there
was, perhaps, the belief and the hope that
she would explain voluntarily. He felt that
something precious would be saved to him
if she confided in him without prompting,
without urging. If he waited, perhaps she
would do so. His sense of delicacy forbade
him to inquire needlessly into her personal
affairs. Surely she was being actuated by
some good reason. That she was committed
to an evil course was a suspicion which he
would have rejected as monstrous. Such a
suspicion did not occur to him.</p>
<p>It did not occur to him until the next
day, when a bolt fell.</p>
<p>He received another communication from
the stable. It was an apology for an error
that had been made. The stableman found
that he had no account against Mr. Harboro,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
but that one which should have been
made out against Mr. Runyon had been
sent to him by mistake.</p>
<p>Quite illogically, perhaps, Harboro jumped
to the conclusion that the service had really
been rendered to Sylvia, as the original
statement had said, and that for some obscure
reason it was to be charged against
Runyon. But even now it was not a light
that he saw. Rather, he was enveloped in
darkness. He heard the envelope crackle
in his clinched hand. He turned and climbed
the stairs heavily, so that he need not encounter
Sylvia until he had had time to
think, until he could understand.</p>
<p>Sylvia was taking rides, and Runyon was
paying for them. That was to say, Runyon
was the moving factor in the arrangement.
Therefore, Runyon was deriving a pleasure
from these rides of Sylvia&#8217;s. How? Why,
he must be riding with her. They must be
meeting by secret appointment.</p>
<p>Harboro shook his head fiercely, like a
bull that is being tortured and bewildered
by the matadors. No, no! That wasn&#8217;t the
way the matter was to be explained. That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
could indicate only one thing&mdash;a thing that
was impossible.</p>
<p>He began at the beginning again. The
whole thing had been an error. Sylvia had
been rendered no services at all. Runyon
had engaged a horse for his own use, and the
bill had simply been sent to the wrong place.
That was the rational explanation. It was
a clear and sufficient explanation.</p>
<p>Harboro held his head high, as if his problem
had been solved. He held himself erect,
as if a burden had been removed. He had
been almost at the point of making a fool
of himself, he reflected. Reason asserted
itself victoriously. But something which
speaks in a softer, more insistent voice than
reason kept whispering to him: &#8220;Runyon
and Sylvia! Runyon and Sylvia!&#8221;</p>
<p>He faced her almost gayly at supper. He
had resolved to play the rôle of a happy man
with whom all is well. But old Antonia
looked at him darkly. Her old woman&#8217;s
sense told her that he was acting a part,
and that he was overacting it. From the
depths of the kitchen she regarded him as
he sat at the table. She lifted her eyes like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
one who hears a signal-cry when he said
casually:</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you gone riding any more since
that other time, Sylvia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Sylvia hesitated. &#8220;&#8216;That other time&#8217;&#8221; she
repeated vaguely.... &#8220;Oh, yes, once since
then&mdash;once or twice. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you haven&#8217;t mentioned going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I? It doesn&#8217;t seem a very important
thing. I suppose I&#8217;ve thought you
wouldn&#8217;t be interested. I don&#8217;t believe you
and I look at a horseback-ride alike. I think
perhaps you regard it as quite an event.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pondered that deliberately. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And ... about paying
for the horse. I&#8217;m afraid your allowance
isn&#8217;t liberal enough to cover such things.
I must increase it next month. Have you
been paying out of your own pocket?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, of course. It amounts to very
little.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sombre glance travelled across the
table to her. She was looking at her plate.
She had the appearance of a child encountering
a small obstacle in the way of a coveted
pleasure. There was neither guilt nor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
alarm in her bearing, but only an irksome
discomfort.</p>
<p>But old Antonia withdrew farther within
the kitchen. She took her place under a
picture of the Virgin and murmured a little
prayer.

<p>CHAPTER XXV</p>
</div>

<p>It was remarked in the offices of the Mexican
International Railroad about this time
that something had gone wrong with Harboro.
He made mistakes in his work. He
answered questions at random&mdash;or he did
not answer them at all. He passed people
in the office and on the street without seeing
them. But worse than all this, he was to
be observed occasionally staring darkly into
the faces of his associates, as if he would
read something that had been concealed
from him. He came into one room or another
abruptly, as if he expected to hear
his name spoken.</p>
<p>His associates spoke of his strange behavior&mdash;being
careful only to wait until he
had closed his desk for the day. They were
men of different minds from Harboro&#8217;s. He
considered their social positions matters which
concerned them only; but they had duly
noted the fact that he had been taken up
in high places and then dropped without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
ceremony. They knew of his marriage.
Certain rumors touching it had reached them
from the American side.</p>
<p>They were rather thrilled at the prospect
of a dénouement to the story of Harboro&#8217;s
eccentricity. They used no harsher word
than that. They liked him and they would
have deplored anything in the nature of
a misfortune overtaking him. But human
beings are all very much alike in one respect&mdash;they
find life a tedious thing as a rule and
they derive a stimulus from the tale of downfall,
even of their friends. They are not
pleased that such things happen; they are
merely interested, and they welcome the
break in the monotony of events.</p>
<p>As for Harboro, he was a far more deeply
changed man than they suspected. He was
making a heroic effort in those days to maintain
a normal bearing. It was only the
little interstices of forgetfulness which enabled
any one to read even a part of what
was taking place in his thoughts.</p>
<p>He seemed unchanged to Sylvia, save that
he admitted being tired or having a headache,
when she sought to enliven him, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
draw him up to her own plane of merriment.
He was reminding himself every hour of
the night and day that he must make no
irretrievable blunder, that he must do nothing
to injure his wife needlessly. Appearances
were against her, but possibly that was all.</p>
<p>Yet revelations were being made to him.
Facts were arraying themselves and marching
before him for review. Suspicion was
pounding at him like a body blow that is
repeated accurately and relentlessly in the
same vulnerable spot.</p>
<p>Why had Sylvia prevented him from knowing
anything about her home life? Why
had she kept him and her father apart?
Why had Eagle Pass ceased to know him,
immediately after his marriage? And Peterson,
that day they had gone across the river
together&mdash;why had Peterson behaved so
clownishly, following his familiar greeting
of Sylvia? Peterson hadn&#8217;t behaved like
himself at all. And why had she been so
reluctant to tell him about the thing that
had happened in her father&#8217;s house? Was
that the course an innocent woman would
have pursued?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>What was the explanation of these things?
Was the world cruel by choice to a girl against
whom nothing more serious could be charged
than that she was obscure and poor?</p>
<p>These reflections seemed to rob Harboro
of the very marrow in his bones. He would
have fought uncomplainingly to the end
against injustice. He would cheerfully have
watched the whole world depart from him,
if he had had the consciousness of righting in
a good cause. He had thought scornfully of
the people who had betrayed their littleness
by ignoring him. But what if they had
been right, and his had been the offense
against them?</p>
<p>He found it almost unbearably difficult
to walk through the streets of Eagle Pass
and on across the river. What had been
his strength was now his weakness. His
loyalty to a good woman had been his armor;
but what would right-thinking people say of
his loyalty to a woman who had deceived
him, and who felt no shame in continuing
to deceive him, despite his efforts to surround
her with protection and love?</p>
<p>And yet ... what did he know against
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
Sylvia? She had gone riding&mdash;that was
all. That, and the fact that she had made
a secret of the matter, and had perhaps
given him a false account of the manner in
which she had paid for her outings.</p>
<p>He must make sure of much more than he
already knew. Again and again he clinched
his hands in the office and on the street.
He would not wrong the woman he loved.
He would not accept the verdict of other
people. He would have positive knowledge
of his own before he acted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXVI</p>
</div>

<p>Harboro had admitted a drop of poison
to his veins and it was rapidly spreading to
every fibre of his being. He was losing the
power to think clearly where Sylvia was
concerned. Even the most innocent acts
of hers assumed new aspects; and countless
circumstances which in the past had seemed
merely puzzling to him arose before him now
charged with deadly significance.</p>
<p>His days became a torture to him. He
could not lose himself in a crowd, and draw
something of recuperation from a sense of
obscurity, a feeling that he was not observed.
He seemed now to be cruelly visible to every
man and woman on both sides of the river.
Strangers who gave more than the most
indifferent glance to his massive strength
and romantic, swarthy face, with its fine
dark eyes and strong lines and the luxuriant
black mustache, became to him furtive witnesses
to his shame&mdash;secret commentators
upon his weakness. He recalled pictures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
of men held in pillories for communities to
gibe at&mdash;and he felt that his position was
not unlike theirs. He had at times a frantic
realization that he had unconquerable
strength, but that by some ironic circumstance
he could not use it.</p>
<p>If his days were sapping his vigor and
driving him to the verge of madness, his
nights were periods of a far more destructive
torture. He had resolved that Sylvia should
see no change in him; he was trying to persuade
himself that there <i>was</i> no change in
him. Yet at every tenderly inquiring glance
of hers he felt that the blood must start
forth on his forehead, that body and skull
must burst from the tumult going on within
them.</p>
<p>It was she who brought matters to a climax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harboro, you&#8217;re not well,&#8221; she said one
evening when her hand about his neck had
won no response beyond a heavy, despairing
gesture of his arm. His eyes were fixed
on vacancy and were not to be won away
from their unseeing stare.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, Sylvia,&#8221; he said, trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
arouse himself. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to fight
against it, but I&#8217;m all out of sorts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go away for a while,&#8221; she said.
She climbed on his knee and assumed a
prettily tyrannical manner. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been
working too hard. They must give you a
vacation, and you must go entirely away.
For two weeks at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>The insidious poison that was destroying
him spread still further with a swift rush
at that suggestion. She would be glad to
have him out of the way for a while. Were
not unfaithful wives always eager to send
their husbands away? He closed his eyes
resolutely and his hands gripped the arms
of his chair. Then a plan which he had
been vaguely shaping took definite form.
She was really helping him to do the thing
he felt he must do.</p>
<p>He turned to her heavily like a man under
the influence of a drug. &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll go away
for a while,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make arrangements
right away&mdash;to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll go with you,&#8221; she said with decision,
&#8220;and help to drive the evil hours
away.&#8221; She had his face between her hands
and was smiling encouragingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>The words were like a dagger thrust.
Surely, they were proof of fidelity, of affection,
and in his heart he had condemned her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you like to go with me, Sylvia?&#8221;
he asked. His voice had become husky.</p>
<p>She drew back from him as if she were
performing a little rite. Her eyes filled with
tears. &#8220;Harboro!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;do you need
to ask me that?&#8221; Her fingers sought his
face and traveled with ineffable tenderness
from line to line. It was as if she were playing
a little love-lyric of her own upon a
beautiful harp. And then she fell upon his
breast and pressed her cheek to his. &#8220;Harboro!&#8221;
she cried again. She had seen only
the suffering in his eyes.</p>
<p>He held her in his arms and leaned back
with closed eyes. A hymn of praise was
singing through all his being. She loved
him! she loved him! And then that hymn
of praise sank to pianissimo notes and was
transformed by some sort of evil magic
to something shockingly different. It was
as if a skillful yet unscrupulous musician
were constructing a revolting medley, placing
the sacred song in juxtaposition with
the obscene ditty. And the words of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
revolting thing were &#8220;Runyon and Sylvia!
Runyon and Sylvia!&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened his eyes resolutely. &#8220;We&#8217;re
making too much over a little matter,&#8221; he
said with an obvious briskness which hid
the cunning in his mind. &#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ve
been sticking to things too close. I&#8217;ll take a
run down the line and hunt up some of the
old fellows&mdash;down as far as Torreon at least.
I&#8217;ll rough it a little. I suspect things have
been a little too soft for me here. Maybe
some of the old-timers will let me climb up
into a cab and run an engine again. That&#8217;s
the career for a man&mdash;with the distance rushing
upon you, and your engine swaying like
a bird in the air! That will fix me!&#8221;</p>
<p>He got up with an air of vigor, helping
Sylvia to her feet. &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be the
sort of experience a woman could share,&#8221;
he added. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stay here at home and
get a little rest yourself. I must have been
spoiling things for you, too.&#8221; He looked at
her shrewdly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; she said honestly. &#8220;I&#8217;m only
sorry I didn&#8217;t realize earlier that you need
to get away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>She went out of the room with something
of the regal industry of the queen bee, as if
she were the natural source of those agencies
which sustain and heal. He heard her as
she busied herself in their bedroom. He
knew that she was already making preparations
for that journey of his. She was singing
a soft, wordless song in her throat as she
worked.</p>
<p>And Harboro, with an effect of listening
with his eyes, stood in his place for a long
interval, and then shook his head slowly.</p>
<p>He could not believe in her; he would
not believe in her. At least he would not
believe in her until she had been put to the
test and met the test triumphantly. He could
not believe in her; and yet it seemed equally
impossible for him to hold with assurance
to his unbelief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXVII</p>
</div>

<p>Returning from the office the next forenoon,
Harboro stopped at the head of the
short street on which the chief stable of
Eagle Pass was situated.</p>
<p>He had had no difficulty in obtaining a
leave of absence, which was to be for one
week with the privilege of having it extended
to twice that time if he felt he needed it.
In truth, his immediate superior had heartily
approved of the plan of his going for an
outing. He had noticed, he admitted, that
Harboro hadn&#8217;t been altogether fit of late.
He was glad he had decided to go away for
a few days. He good-naturedly insisted
upon the leave of absence taking effect immediately.</p>
<p>And Harboro had turned back toward
Eagle Pass pondering darkly.</p>
<p>He scanned the street in the direction of
the stable. A stable-boy was exercising a
young horse in the street, leading it back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
and forth, but otherwise the thoroughfare
seemed somnolently quiet.</p>
<p>He sauntered along until he came to the
stable entrance. He had the thought of
entering into a casual conversation with the
proprietor. He would try to get at the actual
facts touching that mistake the stable
people had made. He would not question
them too pointedly. He would not betray
the fact that he believed something was
wrong. He would put his questions casually,
innocently.</p>
<p>The boy was just turning in with the
horse he had been exercising. He regarded
Harboro expectantly. He was the boy who
had brought the horses on the night of that
ride to the Quemado.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want anything,&#8221; said Harboro;
&#8220;that is, nothing in particular. I&#8217;ll be likely
to need a horse in a day or two, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked leisurely into the shady, cool
place of pungent odors. He had just ascertained
that the proprietor was out when his
attention was attracted by a dog which lay
with perfect complacency under a rather
good-looking horse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty dangerous place, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; he
asked of the stable-boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You <i>would</i> think so, wouldn&#8217;t you? But
it isn&#8217;t. They&#8217;re friends. You&#8217;ll always
find them together when they can get together.
When Prince&mdash;that&#8217;s the horse&mdash;is
out anywhere, we have to pen old Mose up
to keep him from following. Once when a
fellow hired Prince to make a trip over to
Spofford, old Mose got out, two or three
hours later, and followed him all the way
over. He came back with him the next
day, grinning as if he&#8217;d done something
great. We never could figure out how old
Mose knew where he had gone. Might
have smelled out his trail. Or he might have
heard them talking about going to Spofford,
and understood. The more you know about
dogs the less you know about them&mdash;same
as humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went back farther into the stable and
busied himself with a harness that needed
mending.</p>
<p>Harboro was looking after him with peculiar
intensity. He looked at the horse,
which stood sentinel-like, above the drowsing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
dog. Then he engaged the stable-boy in
further conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pretty good-looking horse, too,&#8221; he
said. And when the boy nodded without
enthusiasm, he added: &#8220;By the way, I suppose
it&#8217;s usually your job to get horses ready
when people want them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mostly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro put a new note of purposefulness
into his voice. &#8220;I believe you send a horse
around for Mrs. Harboro occasionally?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; every week or so, or oftener.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro walked to the boy&#8217;s side and
drew his wallet from his pocket deliberately.
&#8220;I wish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the next time Mrs.
Harboro needs a horse you&#8217;d send this fine
animal to her. I have an idea it would
please her. Will you remember?&#8221; He produced
a bank-note and placed it slowly in
the boy&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The boy looked up at him dubiously, and
then understood. &#8220;I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Harboro turned away, but at the entrance
he stopped. &#8220;You&#8217;d understand, of course,
that the dog wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to go along,&#8221;
he called back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Old Mose would be penned up.
I&#8217;d see to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I suppose,&#8221; said Harboro finally,
&#8220;that if I&#8217;d telephone to you any day it
wouldn&#8217;t take you long to get a horse ready
for me, would it? I&#8217;ve been thinking of
using a horse a little myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was paying little attention to the
boy&#8217;s assurances as he went away. His
step had become a little firmer as he turned
toward home. He seemed more like himself
when he entered the house and smiled into
his wife&#8217;s alertly questioning eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, I&#8217;m to get away,&#8221; he explained.
&#8220;I&#8217;m away now, strictly speaking.
I want to pack up a few things some time
to-day and get the early morning train for
Torreon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed quite gleeful over this cheerful
information. She helped him make selection
of the things he would need, and she
was ready with many helpful suggestions.
It seemed that his train left the Eagle Pass
station at five o&#8217;clock in the morning&mdash;a
rather awkward hour; but he did not mind,
he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>They spent the day together without any
restraints, seemingly. There were a good
many things to do, and Sylvia was happy
in the thought of serving him. If he regarded
her now and again with an expression of
smouldering fire in his eyes she was unaware
of the fact. She sang as she worked,
interrupting her song at frequent intervals
to admonish him against this forgetfulness
or that.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>She seemed to be asleep when, an hour
before daybreak, he stirred and left her side.
But she was awake immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it time to go?&#8221; she asked sleepily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hoped I needn&#8217;t disturb you,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Yes, I ought to be getting on my way to
the station.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lay as if she were under a spell while
he dressed and made ready to go out. Her
eyes were wide open, though she seemed to
see nothing. Perhaps she was merely stupid
as a result of being awakened; or it may be
that indefinable, foreboding thoughts filled
her mind.</p>
<p>When he came to say good-by to her she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
put her arms around his neck. &#8220;Try to have
a good time,&#8221; she said, &#8220;and come back to
me your old self again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She felt fearfully alone as she heard him
descend the stairs. She held her head away
from the pillow until she heard the sharp
closing of the street-door. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone,&#8221; she
said. She shivered a little and drew the
covers more closely about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII</p>
</div>

<p>Runyon rode out past Harboro&#8217;s house
that afternoon.</p>
<p>Sylvia, in her place by the window, watched
him come. In the distance he assumed a
new aspect in her eyes. She thought of him
impersonally&mdash;as a thrilling picture. She rejoiced
in the sight of him as one may in the
spectacle of an army marching with banners
and music.</p>
<p>And then he became to her a glorious
troubadour, having no relationship with
prosaic affairs and common standards, but
a care-free creature to be loved and praised
because of his song; to be heard gladly and
sped on his way with a sigh.</p>
<p>The golden notes of his songs out at the
Quemado echoed in her ears like the mournful
sound of bells across lonely fields. Her
heart ached again at the beauty of the songs
he had sung.</p>
<p>... She went down-stairs and stood by
the gate, waiting for him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></p>
<p>They talked for a little while, Runyon
bending down toward her. She thought of
him as an incomparably gay and happy
creature. His musical powers gave him a
mystic quality to her. She caressed his
horse&#8217;s mane and thrilled as she touched it,
as if she were caressing the man&mdash;as if he
were some new and splendid type of centaur.
And Runyon seemed to read her
mind. His face became more ruddy with
delight. His flashing eyes suggested sound
rather than color&mdash;they were laughing.</p>
<p>Their conference ended and Runyon rode
on up the hill. Sylvia carried herself circumspectly
enough as she went back into the
house, but she was almost giddy with joy
over the final words of that conference.
Runyon had lowered his voice almost to
a whisper, and had spoken with intensity
as one sometimes speaks to children.</p>
<p>She did not ride that afternoon. It appeared
that all her interests for the time
being were indoors. She spent much of her
time among the things which reminded her
most strongly of Harboro; she sought out
little services she could perform for him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
to delight him when he returned. She talked
with more than common interest with Antonia,
following the old woman from kitchen
to dining-room and back again. She seemed
particularly in need of human companionship,
of sympathy. She trusted the old
servant without reserve. She knew that
here was a woman who would neither see
nor speak nor hear evil where either she or
Harboro was concerned. Not that her fidelity
to either of them was particular; it was
the home itself that was sacred. The flame
that warmed the house and made the pot
boil was the thing to be guarded at any
cost. Any winds that caused this flame
to waver were evil winds and must not be
permitted to blow. The old woman was
covertly discerning; but she had the discretion
common to those who know that
homes are built only by a slow and patient
process&mdash;though they may be destroyed
easily.</p>
<p>When it came time to light the lamps
Sylvia went up into her boudoir. She liberated
the imprisoned currents up in the
little mediæval lanterns. She drew the blinds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
so that she should feel quite alone. She had
put on one of the dresses which made her
look specially slim and soft and childlike.
She knew the garment became her, because
it always brought a tender expression to
Harboro&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>And then she sat down and waited.</p>
<p>At eight o&#8217;clock Runyon came. So faint
was his summons at the door that it might
have been a lost bird fluttering in the dark.
But Sylvia heard it. She descended and
opened the door for him. In the dimly
lighted hall she whispered: &#8220;Are you sure
nobody saw you come?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took both her hands into his and replied:
&#8220;Nobody!&#8221;</p>
<p>They mounted the steps like two children,
playing a slightly hazardous game.
&#8220;The cat&#8217;s away,&#8221; she said, her eyes beaming
with joy.</p>
<p>He did not respond in words but his eyes
completed the old saying.</p>
<p>They went up into the boudoir, and he
put away his coat and hat.</p>
<p>They tried to talk, each seeking to create
the impression that what was being said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
was quite important. But neither heard
what the other said. They were like people
talking in a storm or in a house that is burning
down.</p>
<p>He took his place at the piano after a while.
It seemed that he had promised to sing for
her&mdash;for her alone. He glanced apprehensively
toward the windows, as if to estimate
the distance which separated him from the
highway. It was no part of their plan that
he should be heard singing in Sylvia&#8217;s room
by casual passers-by on the Quemado Road.</p>
<p>He touched the keys lightly and when
he sang his voice seemed scarcely to carry
across the room. There was a rapid passage
on the keyboard, like the patter of a pony&#8217;s
hoofs in the distance, and then the words
came:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;From the desert I come to thee</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>On my Arab shod with fire....&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It was a work of art in miniature. The
crescendo passages were sung relatively with
that introductory golden whisper as a standard.
For the moment Sylvia forgot that the
singer&#8217;s shoulders were beautifully compact
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
and vigorous. She was visualizing the Bedouin
who came on his horse to declare his
passion.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;And I faint in thy disdain!...&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>She stood near him, spellbound by the
animation of his face, the seeming reality
of his plea. He was not a singer; he was
the Bedouin lover.</p>
<p>There was a fanatic ardor in the last
phrase:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Till the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold!&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>He turned lightly away from the piano.
He was smiling radiantly. He threw out his
arms with an air of inviting approval; but
the gesture was to her an invitation, a call.
She was instantly on her knees beside him,
drawing his face down to hers. His low
laughter rippled against her face as he put
his arms around her and drew her closer to
him.</p>
<p>They were rejoicing in an atmosphere of
dusky gold. The light from the mediæval
lanterns fell on her hair and on his laughing
face which glowed as with a kind of universal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
good-will. A cloud of delicate incense seemed
to envelop them as their lips met.</p>
<p>And then the shadow fell. It fell when
the door opened quietly and Harboro came
into the room.</p>
<p>He closed the door behind him and regarded
them strangely&mdash;as if his face had
died, but as if his eyes retained the power
of seeing.</p>
<p>Sylvia drew away from Runyon, not spasmodically,
but as if she were moving in her
sleep. She left one hand on Runyon&#8217;s sleeve.
She was regarding Harboro with an expression
of hopeless bewilderment. She
seemed incapable of speaking. You would
not have said she was frightened. You
would have thought: &#8220;She has been slain.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s lips were moving, but he seemed
unable to speak immediately.</p>
<p>It was Sylvia who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have tricked me, Harboro!&#8221;
she said. Her voice had the mournful
quality of a dove&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He seemed bewildered anew by that. The
monstrous inadequacy of it was too much
for him. He had tricked her, certainly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
and that wasn&#8217;t a manly thing to do. He
seemed to be trying to get his faculties adjusted.
Yet the words he uttered finally
were pathetically irrelevant, it would have
seemed. He addressed Runyon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you the sort of man who would talk
about&mdash;about this sort of thing?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>Runyon had not ceased to regard him
alertly with an expression which can be described
only as one of infinite distaste&mdash;with
the acute discomfort of an irrepressible
creature who shrinks from serious things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; he said, as if his integrity
were being unwarrantably questioned.</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s voice had been strained like
that of a man who is dying of thirst. He
went on with a disconcerting change of tone.
He was trying to speak more vigorously,
more firmly; but the result was like some
talking mechanism uttering words without
shading them properly. &#8220;I suppose you are
willing to marry her?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>It was Sylvia who answered this. &#8220;He
does not wish to marry me,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Harboro seemed staggered again. &#8220;I want
his answer to that,&#8221; he insisted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I don&#8217;t want to marry him,&#8221;
continued Sylvia.</p>
<p>Harboro ignored her. &#8220;What do you say,
Runyon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of her unwillingness, and the
fact that she is already married&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Runyon!&#8221; The word was pronounced
almost like a snarl. Runyon had adopted
a facetious tone which had stirred Harboro&#8217;s
fury.</p>
<p>Something of the resiliency of Runyon&#8217;s
being vanished at that tone in the other
man&#8217;s voice. He looked at Harboro ponderingly,
as a child may look at an unreasoning
parent. And then he became alert again
as Harboro threw at him contemptuously:
&#8220;Go on; get out!&#8221;

<p>CHAPTER XXIX</p>
</div>

<p>Sylvia did not look at Runyon as he
picked up his coat and hat and vanished.
She did not realize that he had achieved a
perfect middle ground between an undignified
escape and a too deliberate going.
She was regarding Harboro wanly. &#8220;You
shouldn&#8217;t have come back,&#8221; she said. She
had not moved.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go away,&#8221; said Harboro.</p>
<p>Her features went all awry. &#8220;You
mean&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent the day in the guest-chamber.
I had to find out. I had to make sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Harboro!&#8221; she moaned; and then
with an almost ludicrously swift return to
habitual, petty concerns: &#8220;You&#8217;ve had no
food all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bewildered expression returned to his
eyes. &#8220;Food!&#8221; he cried. He stared at her
as if she had gone insane. &#8220;Food!&#8221; he
repeated.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>She groped about as if she were in the
dark. When her fingers came into contact
with a chair she drew it toward her and sat
down.</p>
<p>Harboro took a step forward. He meant
to take a chair, too; but his eyes were not
removed from hers, and she shrank back
with a soft cry of terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t be afraid,&#8221; he assured her.
He sat down opposite her, slowly, as very
ill people sit down.</p>
<p>As if she were still holding to some thought
that had been in her mind, she asked: &#8220;What
<i>do</i> you mean to do, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was breathing heavily. &#8220;What does a
man do in such a case?&#8221; he said&mdash;to himself
rather than to her, it might have seemed.
&#8220;I shall go away,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;I
shall clear out.&#8221; He brought his hands
down upon the arms of his chair heavily&mdash;not
in wrath, but as if surrendering all hope
of seeing clearly. &#8220;Though it isn&#8217;t a very
simple thing to do,&#8221; he added slowly. &#8220;You
see, you&#8217;re a part of me. At least, that&#8217;s
what I&#8217;ve come to feel. And how can a
man go away from himself? How can a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
part of a man go away and leave the other
part?&#8221; He lifted his fists and smote his
breast until his whole body shook. And
then he leaned forward, his elbows on the
arms of his chair, his hands clasped before
him. He was staring into vacancy. He
aroused himself after a time. &#8220;Of course,
I&#8217;ll have to go,&#8221; he said. He seemed to have
become clear on that one point. And then
he flung himself back in his chair and thrust
his arms out before him. &#8220;What were you
driving at, Sylvia?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Driving at...?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t done you any harm. Why did
you marry me, if you didn&#8217;t love me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do love you!&#8221; She spoke with an
intensity which disturbed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you mean&mdash;you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I do!&#8221;</p>
<p>He arose dejectedly with the air of a man
who finds it useless to make any further
effort. &#8220;We&#8217;ll not talk about it, then,&#8221; he
said. He turned toward the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do love you,&#8221; she repeated. She arose
and took a step toward him, though her
limbs were trembling so that they seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
unable to sustain her weight. &#8220;Harboro!&#8221;
she called as he laid his hand on the door.
&#8220;Harboro! I want you to listen to me.&#8221;
She sank back into her chair, and Harboro
turned and faced her again wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d try to understand,&#8221; she pleaded.
&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to ask you to stay. I only
want you to understand.&#8221; She would not
permit her emotions to escape bounds. Something
that was courageous and honorable
in her forbade her to appeal to his pity
alone; something that was shrewd in her
warned her that such a course would be of
no avail.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I was what people call a bad
woman when you first met me. Perhaps
you know that now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s such a silly phrase&mdash;<i>a bad
woman</i>. Do you suppose I ever felt like a
<i>bad woman</i>&mdash;until now? Even now I can&#8217;t
realize that the words belong to me, though
I know that according to the rules I&#8217;ve done
you a bad turn, Harboro.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rocked in silence while she gained
control over her voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What you don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said finally,
&#8220;is how things began for me, in those days
back in San Antonio, when I was growing
up. It&#8217;s been bad luck with me always;
or if you don&#8217;t believe in luck, then everything
has been a kind of trick played on me
from the beginning. Not by anybody&mdash;I
don&#8217;t mean that. But by something bigger.
There&#8217;s the word Destiny....&#8221; She began
to wring her hands nervously. &#8220;It
seems like telling an idle tale. When you
frame the sentences they seem to have existed
in just that form always. I mean,
losing my mother when I was twelve; and
the dreadful poverty of our home and its
dulness, and the way my father sat in the
sun and seemed unable to do anything. I
don&#8217;t believe he <i>was</i> able to do anything.
There&#8217;s the word Destiny again. We lived
in what&#8217;s called the Mexican section, where
everybody was poor. What&#8217;s the meaning
of it; there being whole neighborhoods of
people who are hungry half the time?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was still nothing but a child when I
began to notice how others escaped from poverty
a little&mdash;the Mexican girls and women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
I lived among. It seemed to be expected of
them. They didn&#8217;t think anything of it at
all. It didn&#8217;t make any difference in their
real selves, so far as you could see. They
went on going to church and doing what
little tasks they could find to do&mdash;just like
other women. The only precaution they
took when a man came was to turn the picture
of the Virgin to the wall....&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro had sat down again and was
regarding her darkly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean that I felt about it just
as they did when I got older. You see, they
had their religion to help them. They had
been taught to call the thing they did a sin,
and to believe that a sin was forgiven if
they went and confessed to the priest. It
seemed to make it quite simple. But I
couldn&#8217;t think of it as a sin. I couldn&#8217;t
clearly understand what sin meant, but I
thought it must be the thing the happy
people were guilty of who didn&#8217;t give my
father something to do, so that we could
have a decent place to live in. You must
remember how young I was! And so what
the other girls called a sin seemed to me ...
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
oh, something that was untidy&mdash;that wasn&#8217;t
nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro broke in upon her narrative when
she paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve always been very fastidious.&#8221;</p>
<p>She grasped at that straw gratefully.
&#8220;Yes, I have been. There isn&#8217;t one man in
a hundred who appeals to me, even now.&#8221;
And then something, as if it were the atmosphere
about her, clarified her vision for the
moment, and she looked at Harboro in alarm.
She knew, then, that he had spoken sarcastically,
and that she had fallen into the trap
he had set for her. &#8220;Oh, Harboro! You!&#8221;
she cried. She had not known that he could
be unkind. Her eyes swam in tears and she
looked at him in agony. And in that moment
it seemed to him that his heart must
break. It was as if he looked on while Sylvia
drowned, and could not put forth a hand
to save her.</p>
<p>She conquered her emotion. She only
hoped that Harboro would hear her to the
end. She resumed: &#8220;And when I began
to see that people are expected to shape
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
their own lives, mine had already been
shaped. I couldn&#8217;t begin at a beginning,
really; I had to begin in the middle. I had
to go on weaving the threads that were
already in my hands&mdash;the soiled threads. I
met nice women after a while&mdash;women from
the San Antonio missions, I think they
were; and they were kind to me and gave
me books to read. One of them took me to
the chapel&mdash;where the clock ticked. But
they couldn&#8217;t really help me. I think they
did influence me more than I realized, possibly;
for my father began to tell them I
wasn&#8217;t at home ... and he brought me
out here to Eagle Pass soon after they began
to befriend me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro was staring at her with a vast
incredulity. &#8220;And then&mdash;?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then it went on out here&mdash;though
it seemed different out here. I had the feeling
of being shut out, here. In a little town
people know. Life in a little town is like
just one checker-board, with a game going
on; but the big towns are like a lot of checkerboards,
with the men on some of them in
disorder, and not being watched at all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span></p>
<p>Harboro was shaking his head slowly, and
she made an effort to wipe some of the blackness
from the picture. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t believe
I didn&#8217;t have standards that I kept to. Some
women of my kind would have lied or stolen,
or they would have made mischief for people.
And then there were the young fellows, the
mere boys.... It&#8217;s a real injury to them
to find that a girl they like is&mdash;is not nice.
They&#8217;re so wonderfully ignorant. A woman
is either entirely good or entirely bad in
their eyes. You couldn&#8217;t really do anything
to destroy their faith, even when they
pretended to be rather rough and wicked.
I wasn&#8217;t that kind of a bad woman, at
least.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s brow had become furrowed,
with impatience, seemingly. &#8220;But your marriage
to me, Sylvia?&#8221; He put the question
accusingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you knew&mdash;at first. I thought
you <i>must</i> know. There are men who will
marry the kind of woman I was. And it
isn&#8217;t just the little or worthless men, either.
Sometimes it is the big men, who can understand
and be generous. Up to the time of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
our marriage I thought you knew and that
you were forgiving everything. And at
last I couldn&#8217;t bear to tell you. Not alone
from fear of losing you, but I knew it would
hurt you horribly, and I hoped ... I had
made up my mind ... I <i>was</i> truly loyal to
you, Harboro, until they tricked me in my
father&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro continued to regard her, a judge
unmoved. &#8220;And Runyon, Sylvia&mdash;Runyon?&#8221;
he asked accusingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that&#8217;s the thing you couldn&#8217;t
possibly forgive, and yet that seems the
slightest thing of all to me. You can&#8217;t know
what it is to be humbled, and so many innocent
pleasures taken away from you. When
Fectnor came back ... oh, it seemed to me
that life itself mocked me and warned me
coldly that I needn&#8217;t expect to be any other
than the old Sylvia, clear to the end. I had
begun to have a little pride, and to have
foolish dreams. And then I went back to
my father&#8217;s house. It wasn&#8217;t my father;
it wasn&#8217;t even Fectnor. It was Life itself
whipping me back into my place again.</p>
<p>&#8220;... And then Runyon came. He meant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
pleasure to me&mdash;nothing more. He seemed
such a gay, shining creature!&#8221; She looked
at him in the agony of utter despair. &#8220;I
know how it appears to you; but if you
could only see how it seemed to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying,&#8221; said Harboro, unmoved.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;d been a little field of grass for the
sheep to graze on, do you suppose I shouldn&#8217;t
have been happy if the birds passed by, or
that I shouldn&#8217;t have been ready for the
sheep when they came? If I&#8217;d been a little
pool in the desert, do you suppose I wouldn&#8217;t
have been happier for the sunlight, and just
as ready for the rains when they came?&#8221;</p>
<p>He frowned. &#8220;But you&#8217;re neither grass
nor water,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I think I am just that&mdash;grass and
water. I think that is what we all are&mdash;with
something of mystery added.&#8221;</p>
<p>He seized upon that one tangible thought.
&#8220;There you have it, that <i>something of mystery</i>,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the thing that makes
the world move&mdash;that keeps people clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she conceded dully, &#8220;or makes
people set up standards of their own and
compel other people to accept them whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
they understand them or believe in them
or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he again regarded her with dark
disapproval she went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;What I wanted to tell you, Harboro, is
that my heart has been like a brimming
cup for you always. It was only that which
ran over that I gave to another. Runyon
never could have robbed the cup&mdash;a thousand
Runyons couldn&#8217;t. He was only like
a flower to wear in my hair, a ribbon to put
on for an outing. But you ... you were
the hearth for me to sit down before at night,
a wall to keep the wind away. What was it
you said once about a man and woman becoming
one? You have been my very body
to me, Harboro; and any other could only
have been a friendly wind to stir me for a
moment and then pass on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro&#8217;s face darkened. &#8220;I was the
favorite lover,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she said despairingly.
And then as he arose and turned
toward the door again she went to him abjectly,
appealingly. &#8220;Harboro!&#8221; she cried,
&#8220;I know I haven&#8217;t explained it right, but I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
want you to believe me! It is you I love,
really; it is you I am grateful to and proud
of. You&#8217;re everything to me that you&#8217;ve
thought of being. I couldn&#8217;t live without
you!&#8221; She sank to her knees and covered
her eyes with one hand while with the other
she reached out to him: &#8220;Harboro!&#8221; Her
face was wet with tears, now; her body was
shaken with sobs.</p>
<p>He looked down at her for an instant, his
brows furrowed, his eyes filled with horror.
He drew farther away, so that she could
not touch him. &#8220;Great God!&#8221; he cried at
last, and then she knew that he had gone,
closing the door sharply after him.</p>
<p>She did not try to call him back. Some
stoic quality in her stayed her. It would
be useless to call him; it would only tear
her own wounds wider open, it would distress
him without moving him otherwise.
It would alarm old Antonia.</p>
<p>If he willed to come back, he would come
of his own accord. If he could reconcile
the things she had done with any hope of
future happiness he would come back to her
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>But she scarcely hoped for his return.
She had always had a vague comprehension
of those pragmatic qualities in his nature
which placed him miles above her, or beneath
her, or beyond her. She had drunk of
the cup which had been offered her, and she
must not rebel because a bitter sediment
lay on her lips. She had always faintly
realized that the hours she spent with Runyon
might some day have to be paid for in
loneliness and despair.</p>
<p>Yet now that Harboro was gone she stood
at the closed door and stared at it as if it
could never open again save to permit her
to pass out upon ways of darkness. She
leaned against it and laid her face against
her arm and wept softly. And then she
turned away and knelt by the chair he had
occupied and hid her face in her hands.</p>
<p>She knew he would no longer be visible
when she went to the window. She had
spared herself the sight of him on his way
out of her life. But now she took her place
and began, with subconscious hope, the long
vigil she was to keep. She stared out on the
road over which he had passed. If he came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
back he would be visible from this place by
the window.</p>
<p>Hours passed and her face became blank,
as the desert became blank. The light
seemed to die everywhere. The little home
beacons abroad in the desert were blotted
out one by one. Eagle Pass became a ghostly
group of houses from which the last vestiges
of life vanished. She became stiff and inert
as she sat in her place with her eyes held
dully on the road. Once she dozed lightly,
to awaken with an intensified sense of tragedy.
Had Harboro returned during that brief interval
of unconsciousness? She knew he
had not. But until the dawn came she sat
by her place, steadfastly waiting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXX</p>
</div>

<p>When Harboro went down the stairs and
out of the house he had a purposeful air
which vanished as soon as his feet were set
on the highway. Where was he going?
Where <i>could</i> he go? That beginning he had
made usually ended in the offices across the
river. But he could not go to his office now.
There was nothing there for him to do.
And even if he were able to get in, and to
find some unfinished task to which he could
turn, his problem would not be solved. He
could not go on working always. A man
must have some interests other than his
work.</p>
<p>He pulled himself together and set off down
the road. He realized that his appearance
must be such that he would attract attention
and occasion comment. The foundations
of his pride stiffened, as they had always
done when he was required to face
extraordinary difficulties. He must not allow
casual passers-by to perceive that things
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
were not right with him. They would know
that he and Sylvia were having difficulties.
Doubtless they had been expecting something
of the sort from the beginning.</p>
<p>He seemed quite himself but for a marked
self-concentration as he walked through the
town. Dunwoodie, emerging from the Maverick
bar, hailed him as he passed. He did
not hear&mdash;or he was not immediately conscious
of hearing. But half a dozen steps
farther on he checked himself. Some one
had spoken to him. He turned around.
&#8220;Ah, Dunwoodie&mdash;good evening!&#8221; he said.
But he did not go back, and Dunwoodie
looked after him meditatively and then went
back into the bar, shaking his head. He
had always meant to make a friend of Harboro,
but the thing evidently was not to be
done.</p>
<p>Harboro was scarcely conscious of the
fact that he crossed the river. If he encountered
any one whom he knew&mdash;or any
one at all&mdash;he passed without noticing. And
this realization troubled him. The customs
guard, who was an old acquaintance, must
have been in his place on the bridge. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
tried to arouse himself anew. Surely his conduct
must seem strange to those who chanced
to observe him.</p>
<p>With an air of briskness he went into the
<i>Internacional</i> dining-room. He had had
nothing to eat all day. He would order
supper and then he would feel more like
himself. He did not realize what it was that
made his situation seem like a period of
suspense, which kept in his mind the subconscious
thought that he would come out
of the dark into a clearing if he persevered.</p>
<p>The fact was that something of what
Sylvia had said to him had touched his conscience,
if it had not affected his sense of
logic. She really could not be quite what
she seemed to be&mdash;that was the unshaped
thought in the back of his brain. There
were explanations to make which had not yet
been made. If he told himself that he had
solved the problem by leaving the house,
he knew in reality that he had not done so.
He was benumbed, bewildered. He must
get back his reasoning faculties, and then he
would see more clearly, both as to what had
been done and what he must set about doing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>He had an idea that he could now understand
the sensations of people who had indulged
too freely in some sort of drug. He
had temporarily lost the power to feel. Here
was Sylvia, a self-confessed wanton&mdash;and
yet here was Sylvia as deeply intrenched in
his heart as ever. This was a monstrous
contradiction. One of these things must
be a fact, the other a fantastic hallucination.</p>
<p>The waiter brought food which he looked
at with distaste. It was a typical frontier
meal&mdash;stereotyped, uninviting. There were
meat and eggs and coffee, and various heavy
little dishes containing dabs of things which
were never eaten. He drank the coffee and
realized that he had been almost perishing
from thirst. He called for a second cup;
and then he tried to eat the meat and eggs;
but they were like dust&mdash;it seemed they
might choke him. He tried the grapes which
had got hidden under the cruet, and the
acid of these pleased him for an instant,
but the pulp was tasteless, unpalatable.</p>
<p>He finished the second cup of coffee and
sat listlessly regarding the things he had not
touched. He had hoped he might prolong
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
the supper hour, since he could think of
nothing else to engage his attention. But
he was through, and he had consumed only
a few minutes.</p>
<p>His glance wandered to a railroad poster
in the dining-room, and this interested him
for an instant. Attractive names caught
his eye: Torreon, Tampico, Vera Cruz, the
City, Durango. They were all waiting for
him, the old towns. There was the old work
to be done, the old life to resume.... Yes,
but there was Sylvia. Sylvia, who had said
with the intentness of a child, &#8220;I love you,&#8221;
and again, &#8220;I love you.&#8221; She did not want
Runyon. She wanted him, Harboro. And
he wanted her&mdash;good God, how he wanted
her! Had he been mad to wander away
from her? His problem lay with her, not
elsewhere.</p>
<p>And then he jerked his head in denial of
that conclusion. No, he did not want her.
She had laid a path of pitch for his feet,
and the things he might have grasped with
his hands, to draw himself out of the path
which befouled his feet&mdash;they too were
smeared with pitch. She did not love him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
certainly. He clung tenaciously to that
one clear point. There lay the whole situation,
perfectly plain. She did not love him.
She had betrayed him, had turned the face
of the whole community against him, had
permitted him to affront the gentle people
who had unselfishly aided him and given
him their affection.</p>
<p>He wandered about the streets until nearly
midnight, and then he engaged a room in
the <i>Internacional</i> and assured himself that
it was time to go to bed. He needed a good
rest. To-morrow he would know what to do.</p>
<p>But the sight of the room assigned to him
surprised him in some odd way&mdash;as if every
article of furniture in it were mocking him. It
was not a room really to be used, he thought.
At least, it was not a room for him to use.
He did not belong in that bed; he had a
bed of his own, in the house he had built
on the Quemado Road. And then he remembered
the time when he had been able
to hang his hat anywhere and consider himself
at home, and how he had always been
grateful for a comfortable bed, no matter
where. That was the feeling which he must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
get back again. He must get used to the
strangeness of things, so that such a room
as this would seem his natural resting-place,
and that other house which had been destroyed
for him would seem a place of shame,
to be avoided and forgotten.</p>
<p>He slept fitfully. The movements of trains
in the night comforted him in a mournful
fashion. They reminded him of that other
life, which might be his again. But even in
his waking moments he reached out to the
space beside him to find Sylvia, and the returning
full realization of all that had happened
brought a groan to his throat.</p>
<p>He dressed in the morning with a feeling
of guilt, mingled with a sense of relief. He
had slept where he had had no business to
sleep. He had been idle at a time when he
should have been active. He had done
nothing, and there was much to be done.
He had not even rested.</p>
<p>He put on an air of briskness, as one will
don a garment, as he ordered coffee and rolls
in the dining-room. There were things to
be attended to. He must go over to the
offices and write out his resignation. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
must see the General Manager and ask
him for work on the road elsewhere. He
must transfer his holdings&mdash;his house and
bank-account&mdash;to Sylvia. He had no need
of house or money, and she would need them
badly now. And then ... then he must
begin life anew.</p>
<p>It was all plain; yet his feet refused to
bear him in the direction of the railroad
offices; his mind refused to grapple with
the details of the task of transferring to
Sylvia the things he owned. Something constructive,
static, in the man&#8217;s nature stayed
him.</p>
<p>He wandered away from the town during
the day, an aimless impulse carrying him
quite out into the desert. He paused to inspect
little irrigated spots where humble
gardens grew. He paused at mean <i>adobe</i>
huts and talked to old people and to children.
Again and again he came into contact
with conditions which annoyed and bewildered
him. People were all bearing their
crosses. Some were hopelessly ill, waiting
for death to relieve them, or they were old
and quite useless. And all were horribly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
poor, casting about for meagre food and
simple clothing which seemed beyond their
reach. They were lonely, overburdened, despondent,
darkly philosophical.</p>
<p>What was the meaning of human life, he
wondered? Were men and women created
to suffer, to bear crosses which were not of
their own making, to suffer injustices which
seemed pointless?...</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon he was back in
Piedras Negras again. He had eaten nothing
save a handful of figs which an old woman
had given him, together with a bowl of goat&#8217;s
milk. He had wished to pay for them, but
the old woman had shaken her head and
turned away.</p>
<p>He encountered a tourist in clerical garb&mdash;a
thin-chested man with a colorless face,
but with sad, benevolent eyes&mdash;sitting in the
plaza near the sinister old <i>cuartel</i>. He sat
down and asked abruptly in a voice strangely
high-pitched for his own:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a man ever justified in leaving his
wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tourist looked startled; but he was
a man of tact and wisdom, evidently, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
quickly adjusted himself to what was plainly
a special need, an extraordinary condition.
&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s a very old question,&#8221; he replied
gently. &#8220;It&#8217;s been asked often, and there
have been many answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But is he?&#8221; persisted Harboro.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are various conditions. If a man
and a woman do not love each other, wouldn&#8217;t
it seem wiser for them to rectify the mistake
they had made in marrying? But if they
love each other ... it seems to me quite a
simple matter then. I should say that under
no circumstances should they part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if the wife has sinned?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear man ... sinned; it&#8217;s a difficult
word. Let us try to define it. Let us
say that a sin is an act deliberately committed
with the primary intention of inflicting
an injury upon some one. It becomes an
ugly matter. Very few people sin, if you
accept my definition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro was regarding him with dark
intentness.</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; resumed the other man,
&#8220;we often use the word sin when we mean
only a weakness. And a weakness in an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
individual should make us cleave fast to
him, so that he may not be wholly lost. I
can&#8217;t think of anything so cruel as to desert
one who has stumbled through weakness.
The desertion would be the real sin. Weaknesses
are a sort of illness&mdash;and even a pigeon
will sit beside its mate and mourn, when its
mate is ill. It is a beautiful lesson in fidelity.
A soldier doesn&#8217;t desert his wounded comrade
in battle. He bears him to safety&mdash;or
both perish together. And by such deeds is
the consciousness of God established in us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; commanded Harboro. He
clinched his fists. A phrase had clung to
him: &#8220;He bears him to safety or both perish
together!&#8221;</p>
<p>He arose from the seat he had taken and
staggered away half a dozen steps, his hands
still clinched. Then, as if remembering, he
turned about so that he faced the man who
had talked to him. Beyond loomed the
ancient church in which Sylvia had said it
would seem possible to find God. Was He
there in reality, and was this one of His angels,
strayed a little distance from His side?
It was not the world&#8217;s wisdom that this man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
spoke, and yet how eternally true his words
had been! A flock of pigeons flew over the
plaza and disappeared in the western glow
where the sun was setting. &#8220;Even a pigeon
will sit by its mate and mourn....&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro gazed at the man on the bench.
His face moved strangely, as a dark pool
will stir from the action of an undercurrent.
He could not speak for a moment, and then
he called back in a voice like a cry: &#8220;I thank
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are welcome&mdash;brother!&#8221; was the response.
The man on the bench was smiling.
He coughed a little, and wondered if the
open-air treatment the physician had prescribed
might not prove a bit heroic. When
he looked about him again his late companion
was gone.</p>
<p>Harboro was hurrying down toward the
Rio Grande bridge. He was trying to put
a curb on his emotions, on his movements.
It would never do for him to hurry through
the streets of Eagle Pass like a madman.
He must walk circumspectly.</p>
<p>He was planning for the future. He would
take Sylvia away&mdash;anywhere. They would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
begin their married life anew. He would
take her beyond the ordinary temptations.
They would live in a tent, an igloo, in the
face of a cliff. He would take her beyond
the reach of the old evil influences, where
he could guide her back to the paths she had
lost. He would search out some place where
there was never a dun horse with golden
dapples, and a rider who carried himself
like a crier of God, carrying glad tidings
across the world.</p>
<p>Yet he was never conscious of the manner
in which he made that trying journey. He
was recalled to self when he reached his
own door. He realized that he was somewhat
out of breath. The night had fallen
and the house revealed but little light from
the front. Through the door he could see
that the dining-room was lighted. He tried
the door stealthily and entered with caution.
It would not do to startle Sylvia.</p>
<p>Ah&mdash;that was her voice in the dining-room.
The telephone bell had sounded,
just as he opened the door, and she was
responding to the call.</p>
<p>Her voice seemed cold at first: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
catch the name.&#8221; And then it turned to
a caress: &#8220;Oh, Mendoza&mdash;I didn&#8217;t hear at
first. Of course, I want to see you.&#8221; There
was now a note of perplexity in her tone,
and then: &#8220;No, don&#8217;t come here. It would
be better for me to see you at my father&#8217;s.
In the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harboro found himself leaning against the
wall, his head in his hands. Mendoza! The
town&#8217;s notorious philanderer, who had regarded
Sylvia with insolent eyes that night
out at the Quemado! Yes, and she had
danced with him the minute his back was
turned; danced with him with unconcealed
joy. Mendoza....</p>
<p>He climbed the stairs slowly. He heard
Sylvia&#8217;s footsteps as she moved away; into
the kitchen, probably. He climbed stealthily,
like a thief. He mustn&#8217;t permit Sylvia to
hear him. He couldn&#8217;t see her now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<div class='ce' style='font-size:1.2em; margin-top:1.5em;'>
<p>CHAPTER XXXI</p>
</div>

<p>Sylvia had spent the entire day by her
window, looking down the road. She had refused
the food that old Antonia had brought,
and the comforting words that came with it.
Something that was not a part of herself
argued with her that Harboro would come
back, though all that she was by training
and experiences warned her that she must
not look for him.</p>
<p>At nightfall she turned wearily when Antonia
tapped at her door.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Niña!</i>&#8221; The troubled old woman held
out a beseeching hand. &#8220;You must have
food. I have prepared it for you, again.
There are very good eggs, and a glass of
milk, and coffee&mdash;coffee with a flavor! Come,
there will be another day, and another.
Sorrows pass in the good God&#8217;s time; and
even a blind sheep will find its blade of
grass.&#8221; Her hand was still extended.</p>
<p>Sylvia went to her and kissed her withered
cheek. &#8220;I will try,&#8221; she said with docility.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>And they went down the stairs as if they
were four; the young woman walking with
Despair, the old woman moving side by side
with Knowledge.</p>
<p>It was then that the telephone rang and
Sylvia went to the instrument and took
down the receiver with trembling fingers.
If it were only Harboro!... But it was
a woman&#8217;s voice, and the hope within her
died. She could scarcely attend, after she
realized that it was a woman who spoke to
her. The name &#8220;Mrs. Mendoza&#8221; meant
nothing to her for an instant. And then
she aroused herself. She must not be ungracious.
&#8220;Oh, Mendoza,&#8221; she said; &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t hear at first.&#8221; She felt as if a breath
of cold air had enveloped her, but she shook
off the conviction. From habit she spoke
cordially; with gratitude to the one woman
in Eagle Pass who had befriended her she
spoke with tenderness. The wife of Jesus
Mendoza wanted to call on her.</p>
<p>But Sylvia had planned the one great
event of her life, and it occurred to her that
she ought not to permit this unfortunate
woman to come to the house on the morrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
It would be an unforgivable cruelty. And
then she thought of her father&#8217;s house, and
suggested that her visitor come to see her
there.</p>
<p>She hung up the receiver listlessly and
went into the kitchen, where Antonia was
eagerly getting a meal ready for her. She
looked at these affectionate preparations indulgently,
as she might have looked at a
child who assured her that a wholly imaginary
thing was a real thing.</p>
<p>She ate dutifully, and then she took a
bit of husk from Antonia&#8217;s store and made
a cigarette. It was the first time she had
smoked since her marriage. &#8220;He&#8217;s not coming
back,&#8221; she said in a voice like that of
a helpless old woman. She leaned her elbows
on the table and smoked. Her attitude did
not suggest grief, but rather a leave-taking.</p>
<p>Then with returning briskness she got up
and found street apparel and left the house.</p>
<p>She went down into the town almost
gayly&mdash;like the Sylvia of old. In the drug-store
she told an exciting little story to the
clerk. There had been a nest of scorpions
... would he believe it? In the kitchen!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
She had been given such a start when the
servant had found them. The servant had
screamed; quite naturally, too. She had
been told that a weak solution, sprinkled
on the floor, would drive them away. What
was it?... Yes, that was it. She had
forgotten.</p>
<p>She received the small phial and paid the
price with fingers which were perfectly firm.
And then she started back up the hill.</p>
<p>Under a street light she became aware
that she was being followed. She turned
with a start. It was only a dog&mdash;a forlorn
little beast which stopped when she stopped,
and regarded her with soft, troubled eyes.</p>
<p>She stooped and smoothed the creature&#8217;s
head. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t follow,&#8221; she said in
a voice like hidden water. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any
place to take you&mdash;nowhere at all!&#8221; She
went on up the hill. Once she turned and
observed that the lost dog stood where she
had left him, still imploring her for friendship.</p>
<p>At her door she paused and turned. She
leaned against the door-post in a wistful
attitude. A hundred lonely, isolated lights
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
were burning across the desert, as far as
the eye could reach. They were little lights
which might have meant nothing at all to
a happier observer; but to Sylvia they told
the story of men and women who had joined
hands to fight the battle of life; of the sweet,
humble activities which keep the home intact&mdash;the
sweeping of the hearth, the mending
of the fire, the expectant glance at the
clock, the sound of a foot-fall drawing near.
There lay the desert, stretching away to the
Sierra Madre, a lonely waste; but it was a
paradise to those who tended their lights
faithfully and waited with assurance for
those who were away.</p>
<p>... She turned and entered her house
stealthily.</p>
<p>At the top of the stairs she paused in
indecision. Antonia had not heard her enter.
(She did not know that the old woman was
standing in the kitchen under the picture of
the Virgin, with her hands across her eyes
like a bandage.) The lovely boudoir called
to her, but she would not enter it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go into the guest-chamber,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;that is the room set apart for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
strangers. I think I must always have been
a stranger here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened the door quietly.</p>
<p>A pungent odor of smoke filled her nostrils.
She groped for the light and turned
it on.</p>
<p>Through little horizontal wisps of smoke
she saw Harboro lying across the bed, his
great chest standing high, his muscular throat
exposed to the light, a glint of teeth showing
under the sweeping black mustache. His
eyes, nearly closed, seemed to harbor an
eager light&mdash;as if he had travelled along a
dark path and saw at last a beacon on a
distant hilltop. A pistol was still clasped
in his dead hand.</p>
<p>The unopened phial Sylvia carried slipped
to the floor. She clutched at her lips with
both hands, to suppress the scream that
arose within her.</p>
<p>He had no right to lie so, in this room.
That was her thought. He had taken the
place she had chosen for her own.</p>
<p>And then she thought of Harboro as a
stranger, too. Had she ever known him,
really?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>Her first thought recurred. It should
have been her right to lie here in the guest-chamber,
not Harboro&#8217;s.</p>
<p>And yet, and yet....</p>
